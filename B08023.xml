            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It were needleſſe to reckon vp in this place all their idle fanſies, &amp; fond dreames about this one point. Howbeit, I would certifie the ſimpler ſort of this thing, how that all of them erred, and wandered in bywayes, how that euerie ſeuerall ſect and familie of Philoſophers ſhot farre wide of the marke. For, as S. Paule teſtifieth: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21.</note> They became vaine in their thoughtes, and their fooliſh heart was full of darkneſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:185160:3"/>
a better profeſsion of our Maiſter, and Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. We know, and are taught ſo to ſay, that God <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</note> maketh the wiſedome of the world fooliſhneſſe. We are inſtructed, and ſo we ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true felicitie of this our life, and the true happineſſe of this our age, ſtandeth in the publiſhing, and preaching of Chriſtes Goſpell, which is to the Iewes a ſtumbling blocke, to the Graecians fooliſhneſſe, and to the Papiſtes new learning: but in deede the power of God to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and the wiſedome of God to the inſtruction of as many as are called both of the Iewes, Graecians, and Papiſtes. This glorious Goſpell of our God was firſt preached here on earth by our Redeemer, and Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe: then, after his aſcenſion, it was carried into all partes of the worlde by the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, with ſuch ſucceſſe, that Chriſtes ſpirituall kingdome was by the ſcepter of his worde enlarged farre and wide. Which thing the deadly enimie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Sathan greatly enuying, &amp; knowing that the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate of Chriſtes kingdome would be the decaie, and downefall of his, laboured by all meanes poſsible, to beare downe his ſcepter, and ſcepter bearers by force and violence, which thing he after a ſorte brought to paſſe, by raiſing vp the ten bloudie perſecutions againſt the Chriſtians vnder the ten Tyrantes, or Emperours of Rome. But the Diuell, ſeeing that this his former poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie would not preuaile, &amp; ſeeing that the Chriſtians the more they were tormented for their faith, the more they grewe, and multiplied, deuiſed to deale no more by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and bloudſhed: but chaunging himſelfe into an Angel of light, ſought meanes how in time of peace he might withdrawe men by little and little from the true Religion of Chriſt, to the counterfeit and hypocriticall religion of Antichriſt. This craftie counſell, and peſtilent practiſe pleaſed the ſubtile Serpent well, which wrought
<pb facs="tcp:185160:3"/>
this effect, that it eclipſed, and diminiſhed the fulneſſe, &amp; beautifull light of Chriſtes kingdome, which was onely mainteined by the ſworde of the ſpirit, that is to ſay, by the worde of God. And becauſe he might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily leade the people out of the way of trueth, his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was wholy hitherto bent, to ouerwhelme the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle vnder the buſhell, to darken the light of the Goſpell, which he brought accordingly to paſſe, by corrupting, and infecting the Prieſthood with the glorious pompe, <note place="margin">The originall of the Pope and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.</note> and vanities of the worlde, with the wanton delightes, and vaine pleaſures of this preſent life. Then, euen then, he ſet Antichriſt of Rome in his royall ſeate as his vicar, <note place="margin">The Pope ſetled in Sathans ſeate, not in Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire.</note> and lieftenant generall, there to rule, and reigne as God of this world in the children of vnbeliefe, bewitching them with ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhoulde beleeue lies, that all they might be damned, which beleeued not the trueth, but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſneſſe. This is that man of ſinne (by which is ment not one particular <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. 4. 9. 10. <hi>Daniel.</hi> 7. 5.</note> man, but a ſucceſsion of men, as by the beare in Daniel is not ment onely one King of the Perſians, but a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Kinges,) this I ſay is that man of ſinne, and that aduerſarie that exalteth himſelfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worſhipped: ſo that he doth ſit as God in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God. This is that wicked man, whoſe comming is by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall working of Sathan with all power, and ſignes, and lying woonders, and in all deceiueableneſſe of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe among them that periſhe, becauſe they receiued not the loue of the trueth, that they might be ſaued. By this meanes Sathan lulled (as it were) the worlde a ſleepe, for the ſpace of theſe ſeuen hundred yeeres laſt paſt. Now ſome man will maruell much how the Pope ſhould growe to ſuch an vnbridled authoritie, as he hath gotten. Surely we can aſſigne no other cauſe but this: ſuch was the will of God, and ſuch was the
<pb facs="tcp:185160:4"/>
depth of his ſecrete iudgement for the contempt of his Goſpell Was it not, I pray you, reuealed to S. Iohn, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apo.</hi> 17. 2. 4</note> the purple whoore of Babylon ſhoulde make all the Kinges and Princes of the earth, and the inhabitantes thereof to drinke of the golden cuppe of wine, full of the abhominations, and filthineſſe of her fornication? The verie beginning, and foundation of Antichriſtes kingdome was laied euen in the Apoſtles time. For S. Paule writ to the Theſſalonians, that the myſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7.</note> began then to woorke: but it was then hindered by the brightneſſe, and puritie of doctrine receiued in the Primatiue Church. Afterwardes it grewe vp by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſpecially by three ſteppes. Firſt, by the great <note place="margin">Flowe the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or Popedome of Rome grewe vp.</note> errors of the heretikes in the Eaſt Church, which Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome doth call the armies of Antichriſt. Secondly, by the lamentable contention, and emulation amongſt the Chriſtian Biſhoppes in the Orientall partes. Thirdly, by the ſuperſtitious deuotion (for I will not call it liberall donation) of Princes, and Emperours. For, after that the wicked parricide Phocas, Emperour of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, <note place="margin">Phocas, who had murdered Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius the Emperour was the firſt Pope maker, for before that time the Pope was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall head of the Church, nor yet for Chriſtes vicar.</note> had geuen the Primaſie, or name of vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop vnto Boniface the third, the Popes authoritie, or rather tyrannie increaſed excedingly. Then they ſought not onely to be Lordes within themſelues, but alſo to be aboue all higher powers: yea, aboue the Emperour himſelfe. This kingdome of Antichriſt from that time forward grew mightily, ſpecially vnder the Emperours of Conſtantinople: and namely, vnder the Emperour Conſtantinus Pogonatus or Barbatus: and vnder the Emperours of Germanie Henries, and Frederikes. Now in this time of darkeneſſe it is much to be maruelled, vnto what vile ſlauerie, and thraldome. Emperours and Princes were brought by the Biſhop of Rome. Some of <note place="margin">Emperours brought by the Pope into shame full ſlauerie.</note> them, being reſolutely perſuaded by the Romiſh Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that the Pope was Chriſtes vicar, &amp; vicegerent: yea,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:4"/>
halfe a God, refuſed no Popiſh ſubiection. One waited at his gate barefoote, and barelegge: another was tied faſt with chaines vnder the Popes table, there to picke vp crumbes like a dogge: another ſuffered him to ſet his feete vpon his necke: another held his ſtirrop, when the Popes holineſſe vauted vpon his horſe: another was thruſt into a Monaſterie, and made a Monke. In ſuch ſlauiſh ſubiection were Princes in thoſe dayes. Then in <note place="margin">The true Churche of Chriſt hath not alwayes bene in a viſible go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.</note> deede the Churche of Rome, the whoore of Babylon, was gloriouſly in open rule: but the true Churche of Chriſt was not in any viſible gouernment, no more than it was in the time of Elias the Prophet. And this was, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled and founde true, which ſay, that there ſhould be an Apoſtaſie, or defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. <hi>Apo.</hi> 13. 15.</note> from the faith, that is, a generall reuolting from true Religion: that iniquitie ſhoulde haue the vpper hand: that no man ſhould haue the libertie of his life, but he that ſhould take vpon him the character, or mark of the beaſt. O wofull, and lamentable times. O moſt miſerable, and vnhappie dayes. And yet the Papiſtes at <note place="margin">The common crie of Papiſtes at this day, which call vs to their holy whoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe Church of Rome.</note> this day crie with open mouth moſt impudently, The Catholike church, The Catholike Church, ſaying, that it hath alwayes bene to be ſene at Rome. They tell vs with ſhame inough, that the Pope can not erre, that his faith is Catholike, and pure without all blot, or blemiſh, and that if we beleeue iumpe as he beleeueth, we ſhall ſurely be ſaued. But we will neuer beleeue Antichriſt, nor run to Rome (albeit ſometime a faithfull citie) to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our faith, and Religion. We wote well, that now it is, and hath bene a great while, the ſinke of all ſinne and iniquitie in the world, the verie ſeate, and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriſt himſelfe. We will not haue that proude Italian Prieſt to be our Doctour, and generall Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, a man made of all abhominations, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. We will not lay the foundation, or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
<pb facs="tcp:185160:5"/>
of our faith vpon the glorious name of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man whatſoeuer. We ſee the end of all Poperie to be ignorance. We ſee they derogate, and detract all from Chriſt and his Paſsion, and attribute their ſaluation to Maſſes, to mens merites, to Saintes prayers, to Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, to vowes of virginitie, to their owne good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and to a thouſand other trifling toyes. We ſee they preferre mens traditions, &amp; inuentions before the truth of Gods word. We can ſhewe, if neede be, at what time, and by which Popes euerie parcell of Papiſtrie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. He that will make a true Anatomie of it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it from point to point, ſhall finde, that it tendeth wholy to gaine, and no whit to godlineſſe. To be ſhort, we knowe by the Scriptures of God, that their Religion which forbiddeth marriage and meates, is a doctrine of Diuels. This was the miſerie, and infelicitie of former <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.</note> ages, in which times notwithſtanding God had his Church, though not alwayes ſubiect to mans ſenſes: in which ages God raiſed vp euermore ſome good men, which inueihed bitterly againſt the Popes intollerable <note place="margin">In euerie age ſome withſtoode the Popes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, though they had not ſuch light of the trueth as we haue now.</note> pride, and tyrannie, as namely Hilarie Biſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> Paulus Cretenſis, and Iohannes Lampeon, both Biſhoppes denied his ſupremaſie, the Church of <hi>Rauenna</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> would not acknowledge the Pope for her head. Nilus Archbiſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> writ a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned booke againſt the Popes primaſie. Afterwardes in <hi>Italie,</hi> yea euen in <hi>Rome</hi> Arnoldus Brixianus, an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent man, oppugned ſtoutely the Popes primaſie, and tyrannie. Counſels, and Synods condemned the Popes ſupremaſie, after whom God raiſed vp here in <hi>England</hi> a valiant, &amp; ſtoute ſouldier Iohn Wickleffe, and in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> Iohn Hus, &amp; Hierome of Prage, with many others, as hiſtories record and witneſſe.</p>
            <p>But at the length, when it pleaſed the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">The happineſſe of this age gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</note> and riche mercie of God, to take compaſsion on
<pb facs="tcp:185160:5"/>
the world then drowned in darkneſſe, he renewed the heauenlie light of his Goſpell, by which Antichriſt of Rome ſhould be reuealed, and by little and little vtterly deſtroyed. Then he raiſed vp mightie Capteines to make warre againſt that ſpirituall Pharao, whom he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like Moſes, and Aaron, to ſafe conduct vs out of the land of Aegypt, out of the houſe of bondage, out of the ſorowfull ſeruitude of Poperie, in compariſon of which, that Aegyptiacall ſlauerie was great libertie. To this end and purpoſe he raiſed vp in this moſt happie, and bleſſed age, ſundrie learned Diuines, as namely, Martin Luther, <note place="margin">The beſt learned Diuines of this our age.</note> Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluine, Peter Martyr, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Bullenger, Gualter, Theodore Beza, Chemniſius, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius, Riuius, Zanchius, Daneus, Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Bradford, M.

Surely this the happie age, which Chryſoſtome fortold, ſpeaking of the laſt times: <hi>Ad nullam rem fugient, niſi ad</hi>

Which thing is come nowe to paſſe in theſe dayes, as we may ſee, how that the preaching of the Goſpell hath greatly preuailed againſt all the raging perſecution of the Papiſtes: the Lordes name be praiſed for it. As oft as we thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Goſpell, we dare auouch, that theſe latter times
<pb facs="tcp:185160:6"/>
are better times, that this age is a golden age. For if Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides the iuſt was called <hi>Graecorum foelicitas,</hi> that is, The happineſſe of the Graecians, we may more worthily call Chriſt our felicitie: and if the age, wherein he liued, was called <hi>Aureaaetas,</hi> that is, A golden age, becauſe iuſtice flouriſhed in it, verelie we may more iuſtly call this our age a golden age, becauſe the glorious Goſpell of God ſhineth nowe moſt clearely in the eyes, and ſoundeth moſt ſhrilly in the eares of all Iſrael.

For, when as certeine of the Papiſtes now of late dayes did painte out old ſuperſtitions with ſuch deceiptfull ſhadowes (as it were) and counterfeite collours, that euen <note place="margin">Papiſtrie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but painted hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and double diſsimulation, with which they haue deceiued the vniuerſall worlde.</note> the very wiſest, much more the fooliſh, and vnwarie multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, was by that meanes brought into errour, verely I feared to what iſſue the matter would grow vnto at length: yea, and I was greatly affraid, leſt that they, which haue a good while agoe bene reclaimed from impious ſuperſtition, to the godlie, and ſincere worſhip of God, and to the pure religion of Chriſt, being by little, and little bewitched by the writinges of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, woulde againe (like blinde men) ruſh headlong, and fall backward into their former darkneſſe of ignorance, &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

            <p>But now at this day, ſeeing that our aduerſaries doe ſhew <note place="margin">Craftie conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance diſcouered and detected.</note> foorth euidently and plainely, without diſſimulation, what

For who now doth not ſee, that the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of ſounde and wholeſome doctrine, doe endeuour to take quite away, to pluck out of all mens heartes, yea after a ſorte to burie wholy, and altogether to ouerwhelme the very ſacred, and holy religion of Chriſte? For thus they teache <hi>Ad verbum,</hi> Woorde for woorde, I will put nothing to of mine owne. <q>That faith <hi>(ſay they)</hi> by which a man doth ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Diueliſhe decrees of the Papiſtes made in their Tridentine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> beleeue, and aſſuredly truſt to haue his ſinnes forgiuen him for Chriſtes ſake, and to poſſeſſe euerlaſting ſaluation, hath no teſtimonie, or witneſſe at all in the Scriptures, yea it is cleane againſt it.

Yea: If any man ſhall ſay, that a man is abſolued from his ſinnes, and iuſtified, for that he doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly beleeue, that hee is abſolued, or that no man is truely iuſtified, but hee that doeth beleeue himſelfe to be iuſtified, and that our abſolution, and iuſtification is fully perfected, and finiſhed onely by this faith, let him bee accurſed, I tremble, and quake to rehearſe ſuch deuiliſh decrees of vngodlie men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They will haue faith to bee onely a ſimple credulitie, and a <note place="margin">VVhat the papiſts haue euer taken faith to be.</note> bare knowledge of the hiſtorie of Chriſt, and not alſo a ſtedfaſt
<pb facs="tcp:185160:9"/>
truſt, and beliefe in Chriſt, as S. Paul in all his Epiſtles vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it. They woulde haue vs continually to doubte of the good will of God towardes vs. They denie that a man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only by truſt, and beliefe in the mercie of God, pardoning our ſinnes for Chriſtes ſake: that is, they denie that a man is iuſtified, Gratis, freely (as S. Paul ſaith) euen by the grace of <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 8. 9.</note> God, and that without woorkes. They denie that faith is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for all men to the obteining of pardon, and remiſſion of their ſinnes. They denie that faith is alwayes neceſſarie to abſolution from our ſinnes: that is (to ſpeake more plainly) they denie that wee ought neceſſarily to beleeue the Goſpell. For, I pray you, what other thing is abſolution, but the voice <note place="margin">Abſolution, what it is.</note> of the Goſpell, ſounding by the miniſter of the Church, by which voice that remiſſion of ſinnes, promiſed to the penitent in the Goſpell, is priuately, and particularly applied to euery mans conſcience. And ſeeing that our Sauiour Chriſt, in the Goſpell of S. Marke, flatly commaundeth both, namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <note place="margin">Mark. 1. 15.</note> and to beleeue the Goſpell, beholde heere the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble boldneſſe, or rather impudencie of our aduerſaries. For they very willingly graunt the one, that we ought to repent: but verily they doe ſo ſtoutly denie the other: namely, that <note place="margin">The Papiſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that we ought to beleeue the Goſpell.</note> wee ought to beleeue the Goſpell, that is, the preaching of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, that they accurſe, and condemne euery one that affirmeth this to bee true. Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Credite E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelio,</hi> that is, Beleeue the Goſpell: but theſe men ſay quite contrary: <q>If any man <hi>(ſay they)</hi> ſhall affirme, that in abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinnes wee muſt beleeue the Goſpell, let him bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. Now what an abſurde thing alſo is this their Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema? If any man ſhall ſay, that if grace bee loſt through ſinne, faith alſo is alwayes together loſt with it: or that, that faith, which doth remaine, is not a true faith, although it bee not a liuely faith: or that hee, which hath faith without charitie, is not a Chriſtian: let him bee accurſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, to be briefe, they affirme that adulterers, manquel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, extortioners, and ſuch like, (whome S. Paule denieth euer
<pb facs="tcp:185160:9"/>
to be heires of the kingdome of God) perſiſting ſtill in their <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 5.</note> ſinne and wickedneſſe, may conceiue ſome hope, and truſt of their ſaluation, and may promiſe vnto them ſelues, that God for Chriſtes ſake, will be mercifull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fauorable vnto them: for that is it which we call, To beleeue. If this their aſſertion <note place="margin">VVhat it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</note> be true, then ſurely the Apoſtle S. Paule is in an errour. But if it bee impietie to graunt that the Apoſtle erred, then they them ſelues doe erre, and are deceiued, and doe manifeſtly teach a falſhood. In the meane while (ſuch is the miſerable blindeneſſe of thoſe mens mindes,) they doe not ſee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how that they ſpeake contraries. They doe denie that <note place="margin">Contrarieties in the doctrine of the Papiſtes.</note> there is any liuely faith in heinous ſinners, and wicked offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Ergo it neceſſarily followeth, that their faith is a dead faith, ſuch an one as the Diuels alſo may haue in them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as S. Iames witneſſeth. How therefore can that faith <note place="margin">Iames 2. 19.</note> be founde true, which is dead? Here I doe beleeue they will coyne, and bring foorth out of their owne braine (as Iupiter brought forth Minerua out of his head) a new definition of faith. But let vs briefly haue a viewe alſo of other of their Diueliſh decrees. <q>The Catholike Church (ſay they) doeth <note place="margin">Traditions of the Church of Rome.</note> reteine, and receiue whatſoeuer the chaire of Peter hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out, doeth giue out, and ſhall giue out concerning faith, and religion. Hereby you may eaſily vnderſtand, how greate the credite of the Church of Rome, and the authoritie of the Apostolicall ſeate is amongſt them. Let vs proceede on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the reſt. Eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions, (ſay they) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions.</note> faſtes, feaſtes, and abſtinence from meates, and many other thinges, doe bind a man in conſcience to obſerue, and keepe them, <hi>Etiam extra caſum ſcandali,</hi> yea without the caſe of offence to any. This is a hard ſaying. But what follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth? Chriſt (ſay they) doeth giue, and graunt many thinges <note place="margin">Merites and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions of Saintes.</note> vnto vs here on earth, through the merites, and interceſſion of Saintes, which otherwiſe he would not beſtowe vppon vs: Wherefore they doe verie holily and religiouſly, which with a deuoute pietie, and godlineſſe doe viſite thoſe places, which are
<pb facs="tcp:185160:10"/>
dedicated to them, and which by this meanes ſeeke for helpe at their handes. Here you ſee that they doe allowe prayer to the deade, and Pilgrimages, inſtituted for religion, and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſake. What ſay they elſe? The vſe of images (ſay they) is <note place="margin">VVoorshipping of images.</note> acceptable, and gratefull to God, and we doe well to fall downe flat before them, calling vpon the Saintes whome they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Theſe verely are plaine, and euident inough, neither neede they any larger explication. Let vs therefore goe on forward to the reſt. We muſt firmely, and ſtedfaſtly beleeue <note place="margin">Purgatorie.</note> (ſay they) that there is after this life a Purgatorie for ſoules departed, in which is payed the puniſhment, as yet due for ſinnes. Notwithſtanding they may be ſuccoured, and holpen by the ſacrifice of the altar, by prayer, by faſting, by almes deedes, and by other workes of the liuing, as alſo by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, that they may the ſooner by that meanes be deliuered, and ſet free from thence.</q>

            <p>Now verely that appeareth plainely, which I ſaide in the beginning, what the aduerſaries, and enimies of the Goſpell goe about: namely to take quite away at once all faith, all godlineſſe, all holineſſe, all religion, yea the pure and ſincere <note place="margin">The drift of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.</note> ſeruice of God: finally, to burie and ouerwhelme Chriſt him ſelfe, the authour of mans ſaluation: alſo to thruſt vpon vs their owne vaine dreames, the fooliſh, fantaſticall, and doting deuiſes of men: yea doctrines of Diuels (as the Apoſtle calleth <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1.</note> them) to the end that we ſhould herafter direct all the actions of our life by the rule, and ſquire of the Popes will, nothing at all regarding either what God willeth, and commaundeth, or what he prohibiteth, and forbiddeth vs to doe: whome the <note place="margin">Papiſtes plaine Epicures.</note> Papiſtes (becauſe they are flat Epicures) doe neither wiſhe to be mercifull vnto them, nor feare him when he is diſpleaſed with them. But let vs render immortall thankes vnto God, the eternall father of our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which hath ſuffered the follie, and madneſſe of the Papiſtes to be ſo manifeſted at this day, that no man now can doubt any more, what opinion, and perſuaſion all of vs ought to haue of
<pb facs="tcp:185160:10"/>
them. For they are indeed deceiuers of mens mindes (as S. Paule ſaith vnto Titus) and men that turne away from the <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 10. 2. Tim. 3. 8.</note> trueth: yea verely (as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith vnto Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie) men that reſiſt the trueth, as Iannes, and Iambres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Moſes. But they ſhall preuaile no longer. For as the <note place="margin">Iannes and Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres Magicians.</note> madneſſe of thoſe Magicians was then euident to all: ſo the madneſſe of the Papiſtes is now reuealed to all men. For as they are indeed, ſo they are alſo accounted of all men, ſeducers, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 18, 19</note> and deceiuers, the enimies of the croſſe of Chriſt, Epicures, which haue their bellie for their God, which minde earthly thinges, which bewitch men, that they may not beleeue the trueth. Wherefore, ſeeing that this madneſſe of the Papiſtes is now manifeſted to all men, no man can doubt, but that no Chriſtian ought to haue any ſocietie, and fellowſhippe with <note place="margin">A Chriſtian ought to haue no ſocietie with a Papiſt.</note> ſuch kinde of perſons. And if perhaps any man heretofore hath doubted of it, let him now verely ceaſe to ſtand in doubt any more, knowing the impietie of their doctrine, by which they labour to ouerthrow quite from the foundation our Chriſtian Common wealth. Fooles they are, and mad men, which (with the Giants) wage warre with God him ſelfe, and hope to haue <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Papiſtes make warre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God</hi> Prou. 21. 30.</note> good ſucceſſe in the matter, ſeeing that it is moſte truely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the wiſe man, There is no counſell, nor wiſdome againſt the Lord. But that I may come now at the length vnto that, for which I haue ſpoken theſe thinges, of the follie, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Our duetie it is thus.</note> of the Papiſtes: we ought woorthily all of vs to giue as greate thankes to the immortall God, as wee can either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in minde, or vtter in woordes, for the renewing of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall doctrine, and for the diſcloſing of almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable errours, ſuperſtitions, and vices, commonly tearmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes. Now, what kinde of errours, and how great haue beene heretofore in the Church, if any man be ignorant of them, he may with a litle labour coniecture what they are, euen out of the bookes, which the enimies of the Goſpell haue written, out of which wee haue brought foorth theſe few for a ſhew. They doe not vnderſtand at all what faith is, what the Goſpell is,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:11"/>
what abſolution is: finally, what Chriſt is. They teach that <note place="margin">Certeine errours of the Papiſtes.</note> men ought onely to beleeue whatſoeuer the chaire of Rome hath deliuered out in tradition, doth deliuer out, and ſhall deliuer out.</p>
            <p>They will haue men to make choyce of meates (contrarie to the doctrine of the Apoſtle,) yea without the caſe of offence, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 4.</note> They doe allowe, and wonderfully commend to all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation vpon dead Saintes, which thing commeth very neere to idolatrie. They doe approue woorſhipping of images, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages <note place="margin">Places of pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</note> to holy places, as to Rome, to Treuirs, to Compoſtella, and ſuch like. They doe confidently affirme, and hold, that there is a Purgatorie, from whence indulgencies, and pardons may releaſe, &amp; deliuer vs. And who can rehearſe the whole rable of thoſe doctrines, which they teach, all which are full fraught both with impietie, and ſuperſtition? Who hereafter will not maruell, and wonder at the blindneſſe of the Papiſtes in this ſo happie an age, in which after moſt groſſe, &amp; miſtie darkeneſſe of errours (wherein we went all aſtray) there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by the great bountifulneſſe of God a certeine light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world? Indeede all Gods benefites beſtowed vpon vs, ought to excite and ſtirre vs vp to be thank full vnto him: but yet that principall, and ſingular benefite of God in inſtauring the doctrine of the Church (than which there could no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">That ſingular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of God in inſtauring the doctrine of the Church paſſeth all other.</note> gifte be giuen to men on earth) I ſay that onely benefite is it, which of all other wee ought chiefly to maruell at, which we ought moſte to celebrate, and for which, before all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wee ought to be thank full. And the greater the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the enimies of the Goſpell is, ſo much the more verely doe they owe vnto the immortall God, whoſe eyes of the mind God hath opened in this age, to acknowledge and behold the trueth, and veritie. But in this felicitie, and happineſſe of our age, great and incredible is the ingratitude of men to God at <note place="margin">The ingratitude of this age to God for their happineſſe.</note> this day, which I am conſtrained to confeſſe not without great ſorrowe, and griefe.

happely moued, and ſtirred vp thervnto by the abſurditie, and impietie of a certeine writing, which the enimies of the Goſpell publiſhed abroade in Printe: which booke of mine (moſt deare friend) I thought good to conſecrate, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnto you, though it be vnpoliſhed, and written <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore:</hi> and that for theſe two cauſes, both for to declare my good will towardes you, and alſo for your famous godlineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God, and ſingular care of Chriſtian religion: which zeale, and feruent affection I doe againe, &amp; againe pray from my hearte vnto God, that he woulde daily more, and more augment, and encreaſe in you.

For, if thou doeſt endeuour to iudge aright, and to weigh, and eſtimate the matter, as it is worthie, thou <note place="margin">The happineſſe of this our age how great it is, and in what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges it chiefly conſiſteth.</note> muſt needes confeſſe, without all doubting, that within the compaſſe of theſe thouſande yeares, or more laſt paſt, there neuer happened to any age ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as to this our age.

And becauſe the matter needeth not
<pb facs="tcp:185160:12"/>
to be doubted of at all, concerning the ſkilfulneſſe of the tongues, and the ſtudies of good learning, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie at this day: and becauſe we know well inough, <note place="margin">All learning and good ſtudies were laied to ſleepe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age.</note> and too well, that inueterate barbarouſneſſe, and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which before this time ruled and reigned in all the world, I will not entreate any longer of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I minde to ſpeake of the reparation of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affaires: and in this diſcourſe I will bring forth thoſe thinges, which may be good teſtimonies, and proofes, that thoſe wordes are moſt true, which I am not affrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to affirme, of the felicitie and happineſſe of this our age, againſt many mens opinions, and iudgmentes.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore I will diſcouer, and bring to light, what <note place="margin">A diuiſion or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent woorke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall partes, and an appendix.</note> hath bene the ſtate of former times, what ſuperſtitions, what faultes, what abuſes haue crept into the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will declare what hath bene corrected, and amended in doctrine, and what hath bene either chaunged, and turned to better in Ceremonies, or elſe what hath benequite taken away.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I will doe the beſt I can, to confute all thoſe obiections, which may, and are commonly woont to be brought againſt vs in this caſe: Wherevnto I will adde a fewe wordes of the greate ingratitude, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe of men to God for his benefites. After that I haue declared theſe thinges, as the meaneſſe and ſimpleneſſe of my wit will ſerue mee, if (peraduenture) there be any that will reade this my booke, I will ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatch him, and ſend him away.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I wil now beginne to declare vnto you, as breefly as I can, in what cloudes of darkeneſſe we haue dwelled heretofore, and I will comprehend the ſummarie of them (for it were both an infinite, and an vnneceſſarie labour to proſecute euerie part) general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it were in certeine Chapters and cheefe heades.</p>
            <p>Now firſt of all, in the former ages laſt paſt, they
<pb facs="tcp:185160:13"/>
which woulde not onely in woorde, but alſo in deede, both bee, and ſeeme to bee of the Chriſtian name, were woont to behaue them ſelues thus, &amp; were woont both throughly to perſuade them ſelues, &amp; alſo to proue vnto all other men, that they were good Chriſtians by this meanes. For I will ſpeake onely of thoſe thinges which are well inough knowne, and which no man can denie, but that they are done at this day in the Popes dominions.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they did beleeue, that there was one, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <note place="margin">How farre the former age belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aright.</note> infinite, and omnipotent God. Alſo, that the three perſons of the Deitie, or Godhead, namely, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt were of the ſame eſſence, and (that I may vſe the woorde, which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or Nicaene Councell doth vſe) <hi>Homouſios,</hi> that is to ſay, Conſubſtantiall, equall in power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe. And thus farre verely they did beleue aright, and did agree with the Chriſtians of the right faith: but for all this, they had not that opinion of Chriſt (of whome they were called Chriſtians) which they ought to haue had. For, although they did beleeue, that Chriſt was conceiued by the holie Ghoſt (as the Chriſtian Creede, commonly called <hi>Symbolum Apoſtolorum,</hi> doth teach) borne of the virgin Marie, crucified, dead, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the third day roaſe againe from the dead, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded afterwardes into heauen, and that the ſame Chriſt ſhoulde come to iudge the quicke, and the dead: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (I ſay) they did openly, without any doubting, profeſſe all theſe thinges, notwithſtanding, they had no <note place="margin">VVherein the former age did erre.</note> ſound vnderſtanding at all, or full perſuaſion of that pointe, which is chiefe and principall, and vpon which onely our ſaluation hangeth, and dependeth: to wit, that onely Ieſus Chriſt is the author of mans ſaluation, <note place="margin">The chiefeſt point of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> and that no woorke, or merite of man, can claime any parte, or parcell of this praiſe, and glorie: that forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:185160:13"/>
of ſinnes, righteouſneſſe, and life euerlaſting, doth <note place="margin">VVho haue their ſinnes remitted and for what.</note> happen onely to thoſe, which put all their hope, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all their truſt, and affiance in Ieſus Chriſt: and that that pardon of our ſinnes, and righteouſneſſe doeth chaunce vnto vs, neither for any other man, than for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelfe, as the onely price payed for our ſinnes: nor by any other thing, than by faith in the ſame Chriſt. Moreouer, that Ieſus Chriſt is the onely man, which may reconcile vs to God, as being the only Mediatour betwixt God, and man. Finally, that he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is our Aduocate with our heauenly father, the throne of grace, our Biſhop, and high Prieſt, to make interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on daily for vs, the propitiation for the ſinnes of the world: to be briefe, our righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</note> &amp; redemption. And that all men may confeſſe that I doe here ſpeake the trueth, we will rehearſe in order the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, by which the puritie, and ſinceritie of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, concerning repoſing confidence in Chriſt alone, hath bene maruellouſly contaminated, and defiled.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore it is plaine, and euident that the <note place="margin">A Catalogue of ſuch errours wherewith this doctrine, of truſting onely in Chriſt, hath bene corrupted. In what opinion the Maſſe hath bene heretofore ſaide or ſoung. <hi>Apaena &amp; culpa.</hi>
               </note> daily ſacrifice of the Maſſe was done to this intent and purpoſe, and in this opinion: that both the quicke, and the dead might obteine thereby pardon of all their ſinnes, and wickedneſſe. For all men were thus perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that by ſuch a woorke both the wrath of God was pacified, and alſo ſuch mens ſinnes were releaſed, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided them to be ſaid, or ſoung for them, that ſoules were raunſomed, and redeemed out of Purgatorie fire, and that faultes, and crimes committed, together with the puniſhmentes due for them, were wholy aboliſhed. So verely by that meanes that was attributed to mans <note place="margin">The ſacrifice of the Maſſe doeth blaſphemouſly derogate from the onely ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</note> woorke, which is due onely to the ſonne of God, who offered vp himſelfe a ſacrifice, and an oblation vpon the altar of the Croſſe for the ſinnes of the world, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was betrayed, and deliuered to death for vs, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:185160:14"/>
bloud was ſhedde for the remiſsion of our ſinnes: laſtly, whoſe death it ſelfe was the true ſacrifice for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankinde. Furthermore, when as Chriſt had alone ſatiſfied for the ſinnes of all men, theſe fellowes ſhewed vs other meanes, and wayes, whereby we might ſatiſfie God more fully, and amply: as, amongeſt other thinges, Pilgrimages appointed for deuotion ſake, in <note place="margin">Pilgrimages.</note> which verie many conſumed, and ſpent all the time of their life, whileſt they ranne a gadding, and madding almoſt from the vtmoſt endes of the earth, ſometime <note place="margin">Theſe wandering Pilgrims were as wiſe as waltames calfe, which went nine miles to ſucke a Bull.</note> to Rome, or Hieruſalem, ſometime to Treuirs, or Compoſtella: whileſt they goe to ſee, and viſite Saint Michaels Cathedrall Churche and caue in Gargan, and that moſt royall and magnificent Temple of Saint Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retan: namely, all to this end, to ſatiſfie, and appeaſe Gods wrath for their ſinnes, &amp; by this means to obteine ſaluation. Hitherto alſo tend the Popes indulgencies, <note place="margin">Indulgencies.</note> &amp; pardons, either full &amp; abſolute for euer, or els but for a thouſand yeeres, an hundred yeeres, or fourtie yeeres.</p>
            <p>Hitherto tendes the fraternitie, or fellowſhip of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">Fraternitie of Friers falſly thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to be the Communion of Saintes.</note> which ſome men (forſooth) at this day call the Communion of Saintes: and this ſhewe of godlineſſe they pretend to cloake that ſuperſtition withall, and they labour to paint out a fooliſhe and feigned thing wittily with ſuch falſe deceipts, and as it were to adorne and beautifie it with ſome counterfeit colours. Finally, hitherto tend thoſe egregious ſuffrages, &amp; ſuccours of <note place="margin">Suffrages of Monkes.</note> Monkes, which certeinely were wont to be more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then Chriſtes propitiatorie ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the world: yea, the greateſt part of men, reiecting in the meane while our Sauiour Chriſt, nothing doubted to redeeme, and purchaſe with a great ſumme of monie the communitie of Monaſticall workes, as though the <note place="margin">Monkes woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes bought and ſolde for monie.</note> ſaluation of their ſoules did conſiſt onely in theſe. For Monkes commonly were accuſtomed to powre vppon
<pb facs="tcp:185160:14"/>
others the ſuperfluitie of good workes, wherewith they themſelues abounded, &amp; ouerflowed, if there were any that would laie downe redie monie for them, &amp; leauing alwayes enough for the obteining of their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were wont to obtrude, &amp; ſet to ſale thoſe their workes which were ſuperfluous. That theſe thinges are thus truely reported of them, thoſe obligations, or quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances (which are extant at this day) made for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are ſufficient teſtimonies, &amp; proofes.

<pb facs="tcp:185160:15"/>
other men ſo to leane and truſt to theſe trifles (which <note place="margin">Monkes woulde haue other men truſt to their woorkes.</note> are of no value to the obteining of ſaluation) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other thinges they would cauſe men that lay at the point of death, to remember how many, and how great good woorkes they had done, by whoſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and greatneſſe, the offences which they in their life time had committed, might be ouerwhelmed: how much merites they had, to which Heauen was due.</p>
            <p>Now, as concerning the Popes pardons, many men hertofore aſcribed ſo much vnto them, that they would <note place="margin">How much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore men attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Popes pardons.</note> not ſticke to ſay, that by them a man might obteine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, &amp; free releaſement, from all villanie and wickedneſſe: yea, although a man had lien with our Ladie, the virgin, Chriſtes mother, (an abhominable <note place="margin">So did Frier Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell preach at wittemberge.</note> thing to ſpeake of,) and although he had ſlaine, &amp; killed Chriſt himſelfe. For with ſuch ſalt was the ſpeach of the Papiſtes ſeaſoned, and poudered, if at any time they ment to extrude, and ſet out to ſale their pedlarie packe of pardons, as they had commiſsion, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Soules deliuered out of Purgatorie for monie.</note> from the Pope. Some of them alſo were not afraid to auouche, that the ſoule, which was tormented in the fire of Purgatorie, did flee vp into heauen at the verie ſame inſtant, and moment, in which a peece of monie caſt into the boxe for it, did gingle.</p>
            <p>To theſe may be added this their aſſertion: that the red <note place="margin">Popish pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons betwixt the red Croſſe, and the Croſſe of Chriſt.</note> croſſe with the Popes armes (which heretofore was wont to be erected in the midſt of the Churche) had no leſſe force, &amp; might in it, to aboliſhe, &amp; put away ſinne, than the croſſe of our Lorde, and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Moreouer, that if any man had purchaſed the Popes pardons, he needed not greatly any repentance for his ſinnes: onely theſe (ſaide they) were without all doubt ſufficient to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Nay, there haue bene men, euen in our dayes, which would ſay that they had ſaued more ſoules by the Popes
<pb facs="tcp:185160:15"/>
pardons, than euer did S. Peter by his ſermons. What neede many wordes? All of them ſtoutly, &amp; confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed, that indulgencies, &amp; pardons were of power to forgiue moſt fully aſwell the fault, as the puniſhment: and that the ſuperfluous merites of Saintes, together with theſe, might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, &amp; imparted to thoſe, which would pay well, and truely for them. For euery man knoweth this, how that the Popes bull was woont <note place="margin">The Popes Bull.</note> to be recited, and read to thoſe, which were at the point of death, in which bull there was promiſed both a full, and abſolute abolition of all crimes, and alſo that the feare of Purgatorie ſhould be wholy taken away. Theſe thinges verely are ſuch that our poſteritie may thinke them to be but forged fables, which wee notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding know very well not to be feigned, but to haue bene done indeed. Well, ſeeing that there are euen now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <note place="margin">Non ficta ſed fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</note> ſundrie letters, ſeales, and monumentes of theſe matters, there will remaine (if they bee kept ſtill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,) an euerlaſting teſtimonie of Popiſh impietie, which without all doubt will be propagated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to all poſteritie. Hitherto perteines the Iubile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted <note place="margin">Popish impietie.</note> and ordeined onely to pick money out of mens purſes: at which time what mortall men ſoeuer went to ſee, &amp; viſite the holy places of the citie of Rome, obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned moſt full pardon, and remiſſion of all their ſinnes <note place="margin">Iubile appointed as a market for monie.</note> and offences, which they in all their life time had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which thing is well knowen to all men. Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, the eight Pope of that name, was the firſt, which ordeined that this Iubile ſhould be ſolemnized, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <note place="margin">The firſt deuiſer and inuenter of Iubile.</note> euerie hundred yeare: Clemens the ſixt brought it to fiftie yeares: at the length Xyſtus the fourth brought it neerer, and cut it ſhorter, reducing it to fiue and twentie yeares. What ſhall I ſpeake of <note place="margin">Inuocation or prayer to dead Saintes.</note> the ſuperſtitious worſhippe, and inuocation of Saintes? For heretofore almoſt all men did ſo runne to them for
<pb facs="tcp:185160:16"/>
ſuccour, and reliefe, did ſo deſire, &amp; craue of them their aide, and aſsiſtance, as though Ieſus Chriſt had not bene at all our Aduocate, and Attournie with our heauenlie father: yea as though the Saintes alone (keeping Chriſt <note place="margin">The Papiſtes did imagine Chriſt to be a little preatie boy ſtill, whom his mother might commaund.</note> ſtreightlie vnder their tuition, &amp; ſetting him to ſchole) had taken vppon them the patronage, and protection of men on earth. All men were perſuaded, that both by their merites, and interceſſion, they ſhould finde God fauourable to them, that they ſhould bee abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and looſed from the bandes and fetters of their ſinnes, that they ſhould bee deliuered daily from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perils and daungers: ſo much was Chriſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and almoſt quite out of all mens minds. That I may not adde further, that thoſe Saintes were ſundrie times called vpon in prayer, of whome it was not well knowne <note place="margin">Vvhat Saintes were praied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> whether there euer liued any ſuch, or no. Nowe, what a follie is it to attribute Diuinitie to mortall men, and to requeſt aide, and helpe at their handes, whome man him ſelfe hath numbered amongeſt Saintes? to make of men that are departed this life, Ethnicall and heatheniſh Gods? to abſteine from certeine kindes of <note place="margin">A rable of rites and Ceremonies obſerued in the woorshippe of Saintes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to rhe firſt commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me.</note> meates, in the honour and ſeruice of thoſe Saintes? to keepe holie dayes for their ſakes, that ſo thou maiſt giue them this worſhip? to runne (like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Courſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours) into wodds, and hilles? to crouch, and proſtrate a mans ſelfe before the grauen pictures, Churches, and Chappelles of dead men? to adore their images, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their aſhes, &amp; bones? alſo to build with infinite coſt and charges Temples vnto them? to diſtribute, &amp; parte vnto euerie peculiar &amp; particular Saint his proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, vnto euerie ſeuerall Saint his ſeuerall, &amp; ſingular function, &amp; office? to hang vp vpon the pillers &amp; walles of Churches anathemaes or gifts &amp; offrings, oftentimes to light candels at noone day? to burne ſweete franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, to pay thy fooliſh vowes? and who can recount

all thoſe thinges, which men doe for the worſhippe of Saintes, contrarie to the firſt commaundement of the Decalogue, which are not onely full of a certeine ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but alſo of execrable impietie, &amp; idolatrie: yea, which come verie neere well nigh to a certeine Paganiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.

            <p>Thus you haue hard how the ſinceritie of this doctrine (concerning truſt, and confidence in Chriſt) hath bene heretofore contaminated, &amp; corrupted with diuers, and ſundrie errours.

<pb facs="tcp:185160:17"/>
pardons, and bulles, they laboured to bee choſen, and elected into the ſocietie, and fellowſhip of Friers, they gotte for them ſelues both by ſuite, and ſiluer the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Monkes, and the communion of their good woorkes, they fled as ſuppliantes for ſuccour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Sanctuaries of Saintes. And they verely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (ſuch was their blindneſſe) that by theſe thinges they had prouided excellently well for their ſaluation. So greatly did they ſwarue, &amp; erre from the true faith, and beliefe in Chriſte, in that darkneſſe of ignorance and errours: and tooke what honour they ought to haue giuen onely, and ſoly to Chriſt, namely to haue placed all their affiance, and truſt of ſaluation in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that they transferred to fooliſh thinges, &amp; thinges full of impietie, notably reproching, and diſhonouring the ſonne of God, crucified for vs, whoſe death they did beleeue, not to bee of ſufficient force, and of ſtrength, to ſatisfie, and to pacifie God for the ſinnes of mankinde.</p>
            <p>The ſame men of that time as often as either they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <note place="margin">The ſuperſtition of holie water.</note> the Church, or went out of it, did lightly ſprinkle them ſelues with holie water in the Church porch, (which was commonly readie at hand there, through the care of the Pariſh Clerke or Sexton) to wipe, &amp; waſh away by that meanes the daily blottes of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">The maner of Ethnikes to vſe holie water ſprinkle.</note> and ſpottes of their mindes: which thing alſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not much from the ſuperſtition of the Ethnikes.

That ſeemed to be not more duetifull, than honourable. Moreouer, they lighted candels (which thing was thought very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie) to the image of S.

Such a vertue they attribute to their Eaſter waxe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, <note place="margin">The ſuperſtition of an Eaſter waxe candel, and of candels conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon Candel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe day.</note> and to thoſe which are conſecrated vppon the feaſt day of the Purification of Marie, alſo both to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſalt, and bleſſed holie water, in which thinges they thinke there is a power, and vertue, to driue away euill Spirits, and Diuelles. Such a like ſuperſtition there was amongſt the Iewes, and a vaine credulitie of that <note place="margin">The Iewish ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the name, Iehouah.</note> name, which they call <hi>Tetragrammaton:</hi> which being engrauen in gold, they ſuppoſed, that whoſoeuer car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried that about with them ſhould be ſafe, and ſure, by
<pb facs="tcp:185160:20"/>
the vertue, and efficacie thereof, from greate and many miſchiefes. The like ſuperſtition alſo is that, which one Serenus Samonicus writeth of that ridiculous name <note place="margin">The ſuperſtition of the name Abracadabra.</note> 
               <hi>Abracadabra:</hi> that being written after a certeine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a paper, and hanged vpon the necke of him that is ſicke of an ague, doth by little and little driue away the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The ſame men of that time iudged thoſe to be good <note place="margin">VVhat woorkes were heretofore in time of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thought to be good woorkes.</note> woorkes, which there is no man at this day but will confeſſe they were full of ſuperſtition, and idolatrie: as for example theſe, vowed Pilgrimages, gadding into woddes, and hilles, the redeeming of the Popes bulles, the woorſhipping of images and pictures, the adoration of images, the bowing of the necke before Churches, perfuming before the altars of Saintes, the burning of franckincenſe, and waxe candels, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of vowes, giftes hanged vpon the pillers of the Church, the adopting of houſholde gods, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faſtes, choyce and difference of meates, abſtinence from milke, cheeſe, butter, fleſh, &amp; egges, thred bare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, contemning &amp; deſpiſing of marriage, often wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges, lyinges vpon the ground, babbling of prayers which they did not vnderſtand, voluntarie vexing &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting <note place="margin">Stationaries are thoſe which wayte vpon the Pope when he celebrateth his ſtations.</note> of their bodies, the offering of an hired wages to the Stationaries that ſcratch &amp; ſcrape for monie, the election into the couent &amp; fellowſhippe of Friers, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Monaſteries, founding of Maſſes, ordeining of altars, memories, anniuerſaries, the wearing of an image of waxe conſecrated by the Biſhop of Rome, inuocation to dead men for helpe, the hanging of the Goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necke, the walking of the ſtations of Rome, ſupplication to the couerings, and cuſhinges of Saintes, the ſprinkling of holie water, the taſting of conſecrated ſalt, the bearing about of images in publike proceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the worſhipping and kiſſing of vncerteine relikes,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:21"/>
long tedious ſonges in the Church, the houres of our Ladie, ſatiſfaction for ſinnes, the Euening prayer of the virgine, the cenſing of hearbes and boughes, the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Monaſticall life, voluntarie beggerie: and who can rehearſe all the reſt of that traſh?</p>
            <p>Now, what authoritie of the myſticall Scripture haue <note place="margin">All theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med woorkes are not grounded upon the ſacred Scripture.</note> theſe woorkes? What witneſſe of Gods worde? Where is there any mention at all of theſe thinges in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the Prophets, and Apoſtles? Finally, what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandement or example is there extant any where in the holie Scriptures for theſe? Moreouer, what do they auayle to religion? Of what force are they to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine ſaluation? What rewardes are promiſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them? Who either of the auncient Diuines taught theſe thinges, or who in the firſt, and Primatiue Church did euer obſerue them? Laſt of all, what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie I pray you is there of theſe, either to the amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods glorie, or to the profite and commoditie of others? Thus verely it is plaine, and euident how greate a miſt of darkeneſſe there was ſpred ouer all mens minds in former times, ſeeing that of thoſe, which had the charge to teach others, ſuch thinges were inculcated into the eares of the people, indeede ſhadowed after the ſhape of ſanctitie, and holineſſe: but, to ſay the trueth, onely fooliſh deuiſes of men. Such were in old time amongſt the Iewes thoſe thinges, which they had <note place="margin">The additions which the Iewes had put to the Lawe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 3. 4</note> added, and put to the Lawe, which our Sauiour Chriſt mentioneth ſo often in the Goſpell: as for example, broade philacteries, long fringes of their garments, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten waſhinges of their handes, and of pottes, babbling of prayers, ambitious faſtes, and other ſuch like thinges.</p>
            <p>How much better had it bene, to haue inculcated, and beaten thoſe thinges onely into their heades, which come neerer to true godlineſſe, and wherein mans ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſteth? Such we knowe are thoſe good workes
<pb facs="tcp:185160:21"/>
in deede, both verie acceptable to God, and worthie of a Chriſtian man, which both the Table of the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements <note place="margin">VVhat woorkes are truely to bee ſaide good woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> doeth teache, and Chriſt doth command, and the Apoſtolicall doctrine doth commend vnto vs: as namely, the feare of God, repentance, truſt in God, loue towardes him from the whole heart, the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and propagation of the Goſpell, calling vpon God in trouble and aduerſitie, thankeſgeuing in proſperitie, cheerefulneſſe in miſeries and afflictions, perpetuall praiſe of God, iuſtice and vpright dealing towardes thy neighbour, diligence and painefulneſſe in thy office &amp; duetie, ſobrietie, temperance, chaſtitie, and ſuch like. And thoſe which are next in place to theſe, to ouercome <note place="margin">The dueties of a Chriſtian man.</note> anger, to put away hatred, to repreſſe the deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, to refuſe glorie, to loue our enimies, to bleſſe them which curſe vs, to doe good to them which hate vs, to pray for them which hurt vs, raile vpon vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile vs, to recompenſe an iniurie with a benefite, to giue meate to the hungrie, drinke to the thirſtie, almes to the needie, to interteine and receiue ſtraungers into thine houſe, to couer and cloath the naked, to viſite the ſicke, to admoniſhe him that is in an errour, to teache and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ignorant, to helpe the perplexed and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man with thine aduiſe and counſell, to make eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thoſe that diſagree, friendes againe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte the afflicted, and ſuch like.

and an acceptable ſacrifice to God, to crucifie our fleſh, with the affections and deſires thereof, to keepe our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues immaculate, and vnſpotted of the world. He war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and exhorteth vs, that we be renewed in the ſpirit of our minde, and that we put on the newe man, which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23.</note> is created to the image, and ſimilitude of God, in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and true holineſſe: that we be followers of <note place="margin">

He biddeth vs to tame alwayes, and to repreſſe our naturall viciouſneſſe, and our wicked affections, neither to waxe proud, and loftie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, nor to be too much deiected and caſt downe in aduerſitie: whatſoeuer we doe, to doe all to the glorie of God: no man to regard his owne things, but rather <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 4.</note> thoſe thinges which are other mens. Moreouer, to be ſuch that no man may be offended at any time with vs, but that we prouoke others by our good example vnto godlineſſe, and vertue. Finally, he exhorteth vs that we <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 17.</note> pray without ceaſing, that in all things we giue thankes to God, that we alwayes ſigh after heauenly things, and deſpiſe humane, and earthly thinges. Euerie where vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">From what vices doth Saint Paule dehorte vs.</note> both this ſame Apoſtle, and the reſt doe deterre, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort vs from whoorehunting, from obſcenitie, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of wordes, from hatred, and heartburninges, from ſpitefull enuie, from vaineglorie, from ambition, from auarice, from pride, from ſurfeting and gluttonie, and from all other vice, and wickedneſſe. And before all <note place="margin">VVhat manner of faith the Apoſtles teach.</note> things they doe perpetually inculcate that faith, which looke what an one it is within, ſuch an one doeth loue towardes our neighbour ſhew it forth, &amp; repreſent it to be without. Thus you haue heard what be the duties of a Chriſtian man, and the workes which are truely good,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:22"/>
acceptable in deede to God, and which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, that we ſhould walke in them, as S. Paule ſaith <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.</note> to the Epheſians. And theſe verely are thoſe good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which both giue euident teſtimonie of our faith, &amp; declare our minde to be gratefull, &amp; mindfull of Gods <note place="margin">The efficacie of good woorkes.</note> benefites towardes vs, &amp; commend vnto Infidels our Chriſtian profeſsion, &amp; which allure, &amp; inuite our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures to the ſtudie of godlineſſe. If theſe thinges had bene in former ages diligently, &amp; daily inculcated into the eares, &amp; mindes of all men, truely there had not ſo many ſuperſtitions, ſo many vices, &amp; abuſes crept into the Church, as there did: of which now we will goe on forward to ſpeake and to intreate of the reſt, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine behind. But firſt let vs ſay ſomewhat of the Pope, the God vpon earth, as the Papiſtes doe call him.</p>
            <p>They were drowned in a deepe and great errour, <note place="margin">A foule and fond errour to thinke, that the Pope is the head of the Church, Chriſtes Vicar, and Saint Peters ſucceſſour.</note> which were perſuaded throughly, that the Biſhop of Rome was by Gods law head of the catholike Church, the high Prieſt of Chriſtian religion, the vicar of Chriſt, and ſucceſſour of S. Peter, &amp; (as it were) a certeine God amongſt men, &amp; partaker of both natures with Chriſt, and ſuperiour to an vniuerſall Synod, or generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: to whom it was lawfull to broach a newe doctrine, which was contrarie to the doctrine of the Goſpell, to make a new article of our faith in the Creede, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <note place="margin">The Authoritie of the Pope how great it was thought to be.</note> vnto all men a new forme and manner of liuing: who laſtly might commaund, euen the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as his garde attending his becke, and who might at his pleaſure thruſt out of Heauen whome he would: yea, thoſe that were guiltleſſe, and had neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it.</p>
            <p>I omitte, and let paſſe, howe that he commandeth that all the decrees of the Apoſtolicall ſeate ſhoulde <note place="margin">Decrees and Decretalles.</note> bee receiued, as if they had bene confirmed, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the diuine voyce of Peter himſelfe: that
<pb facs="tcp:185160:23"/>
he will haue vs to beare the yoke put vpon vs by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeate, yea though it be ſcarſe tollerable: that he doth ſuffer him ſelfe to be reproued, and rebuked of none, though he doeth leade an innumerable ſorte of ſoules to Hell with him: that he doeth take away in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, rites inſtituted by our Sauiour Chriſt: that he transferreth to his owne conſtitutions, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which is due vnto God alone: that he goeth on ſtill to manteine, and defende doctrines of Diuels (for ſo doeth the Apoſtle call them) concerning forbidding of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.</note> marriage, concerning the vſe, and choyce of meates, and finally, concerning ſuch like thinges: that he glorieth that both the ſwordes are giuen to him, &amp; that he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth <note place="margin">A proud bragge.</note> vnto him ſelfe the power both of the celeſtial, &amp; terreſtriall Empire, according vnto that ſaying, <hi>Data eſt mihi omnis poteſtas in coelo, &amp; in terra,</hi> that is: All <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18.</note> power is giuen vnto mee in Heauen, and in earth: that he affirmeth himſelfe to haue the right of tranſlating the Monarchie which Ceſar now obteineth: to be brief, that he compelleth religion to ſerue his profite, that <note place="margin">The arrogancie and paſſing pride of the Pope of Rome.</note> hee ruleth, and reigneth like a King, that he encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his dominions by warres, that he poſſeſſeth, and holdeth ſtraunge cities by force, by fraud, finally by any pretence whatſoeuer: in ſumme, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth him ſelfe to bee ſet both aboue the Scripture, and the Church, and almoſt aboue God him ſelfe: that hee maketh a gaine of Eccleſiaſticall matters, and of the holy Ghoſt: that he reacheth foorth his feete for moſt noble Princes to kiſſe: that he canonizeth for Saintes dead men, whom he thinketh will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to him: laſt of all, that he breaketh leagues, that he breaketh the faith, and religion of an oth, that he giueth leaue for men to doe againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of GOD, and that he permitteth ſubiectes to forſake their allegeance, and to caſt off
<pb facs="tcp:185160:23"/>
all obedience and loyaltie to their lawfull Prince: and what one man, I pray you, can rehearſe all his doings, of whiche there is neither end, nor meaſure? For I let paſſe <note place="margin">The negligence of the Pope in caring for the Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</note> &amp; pretermit many thinges, which were to be added: of the negligence of the Pope in caring for the Chriſtian common wealth (for he boaſteth that he is ſet ouer it by God as cheefe Preſident, whoſe charge is to ſee that it take no harme) in correcting and amending corrupt doctrine, in aboliſhing wicked worſhips, in aſſembling Synodes, &amp; calling Councels, in amending the corrupt manners of all ſtates, finally, in gouerning &amp; guiding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, &amp; affaires perteining to his office, &amp; func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea, I thought good to paſſe ouer in ſilence thoſe <note place="margin">Popish Edictes and prohibitions againſt all Scripture.</note> thinges, which all the world (almoſt) crieth out vpon: namely, that the Pope forbiddeth many thinges, which either are no where prohibited by Gods lawe, or plainly permitted by the ſame: that he requireth his owne lawe to be of more account, than Gods commaundements, that he prouideth euerie where rather for his owne gaine, than either for Gods, glorie, or the ſaluation of Chriſtian people: that by his indulgencies, &amp; pardons he both augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the libertie, &amp; impunitie of ſinning, &amp; alſo cutteth away all occaſions, &amp; cauſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life: finally, that he neither careth to ſee his own canons obſerued, nor endeuoreth to repreſſe that infinit &amp; vnmeaſurable riotte and exceſſe of the Cardinals of Rome. Hitherto you haue heard of the Biſhop of Rome whome the Papiſtes account to bee our ſupreame Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, &amp; moſt holie Lorde. Some ſalute him with the title &amp; appellation of Prince, &amp; Father of mankind, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vouchſafe to giue him the name, and honour of a terrene, or earthlie God.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to Baptiſme, which ſith that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, <note place="margin">Baptiſme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of Chriſt.</note> &amp; ordeined by Chriſt him ſelfe for mans ſake: namely, that they which are borne by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:185160:24"/>
of wrath, may through a certeine new regeneration by the Spirit, beecome the ſonnes of grace: and that by Baptiſme they might be purged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpottes of ſinne, which they brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the world, when they were borne: this vſe the Papiſtes in former ages maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly defiled. For they were not afraid to baptiſe ſacring belles, &amp; other belles with great ceremonies, yea almoſt <note place="margin">The abuſe of Baptiſme. Belles had God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</note> obſeruing the ſame rites, whiche were vſed in baptiſing infantes. For neither exorciſme, nor vnction is left out: they haue godfathers, they haue names giuen them, and all the reſt of the thinges, which were woont to be vſed in the true Baptiſme, are practiſed very deuoutly, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperſtitiouſly, not without greate reproche, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage, and deſpite of the true Baptiſme: eſpecially, ſeeing here, as in baptiſing of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euerie hedg Prieſt &amp; Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate will not ſerue, but onely the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, namely to this end, that there may bee more authoritie in the ſtage play, whileſt that ſuch a chriſtening is full of pompe. And becauſe Baptiſme was ordeined of Chriſt to be the lauer of regeneration, &amp; the waſhing away of our ſinnes: the Papiſtes were woont to conſecrate with <note place="margin">The ſuperſtitious conſecration of water with ſalt.</note> ſuperſtitious rites (for they had no commaundement of Chriſt concerning that matter) water with ſalt, by which either thoſe that entered into the Church (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) or thoſe whiche went out thence might ſprinkle them ſelues, to waſh away the ſpottes, and blottes of their daily ſinnes, and thoſe light offences and faultes of theirs: which cuſtome nowe alſo laſteth in places of Poperie. <note place="margin">The abuſe of Confirmation.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now what great abuſe was there heretofore of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they call it? For wheras in it there ought to be had a diligent inquirie of doctrine, &amp; a profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith as a chefe &amp; principal thing to be required in biſhoping the Papiſts leauing &amp; neglecting theſe, ſend the children away, after that they haue ſigned them in the foreheads
<pb facs="tcp:185160:24"/>
with the holy Chriſme (to vſe Petrus Lombardus wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des) &amp; geuen them a boxe on the eare. So if you reſpect the true vſe of confirmation, it hath no place at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Papiſtes: and the thing it ſelfe being quite taken away, there remaineth onely the name, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine ſhadowe of an old auncient cuſtome.</p>
            <p>There were alſo many intollerable abuſes in penance, <note place="margin">The abuſe of penaunce and confeſſion.</note> &amp; confeſsion: as for example, that hard, &amp; to ſcrupulous a reckoning vp of all our ſinnes, reſeruing of certeine caſes, that appendix in abſolution of the merites of Saintes, Romiſh indulgencies, humane ſatisfaction for ſinnes, and if there bee any ſuch like.</p>
            <p>In the Supper of the Lorde the cheefeſt abuſe was of <note place="margin">The manifolde abuſe of the Supper of the Lorde amongſt the Papiſtes.</note> Maſſes, eſpecially that manifold number, and great varietie of them, as for trauellers &amp; wayfaring men, for ſailers &amp; ſeafaringme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for women trauelling in childbed: item the Maſſe of the crowne of thorne, the Maſſe of the three nailes, the Maſſe of Chriſts vncircumciſion: what? were they not woont to flee for reliefe vnto Maſſes, as many as deſired, &amp; wiſhed to haue a proſperous &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euent to all things, which they enterpriſed &amp; went about, which ſought a remedie for their diſeaſes, which would gladly eſcape, &amp; ſhun all imminent euils &amp; daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Yea moreouer, Maſſes were thought to be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deliuer the dead fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fire of Purgatorie. For the matter was now come to that paſſe, that that Sacrament which was inſtituted and ordeined to excite, &amp; ſtirre vp liue men to the remembrance of Chriſts death, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholy tranſlated to the dead. I doe omitte the <note place="margin">The Superſtitious reſeruation and oſtentation of the Lordes bread.</note> ſuperſtitious reſeruation of the Lordes bread, and the pompe in which the ſame is carried about, and ſhewed both in publike proceſsions, and alſo in ſolemne vew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of the field in the Rogation weeke. I doe further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more omit &amp; let paſſe that taking away of one parte of the Sacrament from the people, flatte contrarie to the
<pb facs="tcp:185160:25"/>
inſtitution, and ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to matters of greater weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, <note place="margin">That the papiſtes heretofore either knew not at all, or elſe neglected the principall partes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</note> and firſt and formoſt to the promiſes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt to come: in the former age no man had any rememberance, or certeine knowledge of that promiſe, which is the firſt both in time, &amp; order. Such cloudes of ignorance, &amp; errour, did ſo miſerably darken the whole world. And yet there are ſome alſo at this day, which thinke that we doe wreſt that place of Geneſis (in which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</note> is conteined the firſt promiſe) to the vauntage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of our owne cauſe: when as in deede the moſt auncient Doctours of the Chriſtian Church make with vs: as Irenaeus, who not once, or twice, but often teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note> that the ſeede of the woman is that, which Marie brought foorth into the world, to wit our Sauiour. So <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> doth Saint Cyprian vnderſtand that place, in his ſecond booke againſt the Iewes: ſo doth S. Hierome likewiſe, <note place="margin">Hieronymus.</note> which we haue declared in another place: ſo doeth the Authour of that Epiſtle, <hi>De viro perfecto,</hi> whoſoeuer he was that wrote it.

            <p>Here verely Prudentius (the Chriſtian Poet) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">The meaning of Prudentius his verſes.</note> that the ſonne of God, taking vnto him the ſhape, and bodie of a man, whileſt he voluntarily offered him ſelfe to die, did breake the head of that Serpent, which by his craftineſſe, and ſubtile ſleightes had deceiued the firſt parentes of mankinde, and that by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his owne bodie vppon the Croſſe, he made an attonement for the fault, and crime, which our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes had committed. But let vs proceede, and goe on forward to the reſt.</p>
            <p>Heretofore the common ſorte of Chriſtians knewe <note place="margin">Chriſt his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode hitherto vnknowen to the Papiſtes.</note> nothing at all of the Prieſthood, or Biſhoppricke of Chriſt, who hath both inſtructed vs in wholeſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and ſatiſfied for the ſinnes of mankinde by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his owne bodie, whileſt he ſacrificeth vp him ſelfe vppon the altar of the Croſſe, and who daily and perpetually prayeth vnto God for our ſafetie, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Nay, they knewe not in thoſe dayes ſufficiently the <note place="margin">The difference betwixt the olde Teſtament and the new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen. True iuſtification heretofore vnknowen. How much was aſcribed to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and good woorkes.</note> difference betwixt the newe Teſtament, and the olde, betwixte the Lawe, and the Goſpell, betwixte Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Chriſt, which thing bringeth a great light to the whole Scripture. Neither did they thinke aright (which a man might woorthily maruell at) of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: becauſe they did beleeue that good woorkes did almoſt onely auayle to the obteining of forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, to the ſatiſfaction for crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:26"/>
to the obteining of righteouſneſſe, to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from death, and hell fire: briefely, to the obteining of eternall bleſſedneſſe. Therefore, they both truſted to their owne merites, and put their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their good woorkes, and good deedes, and ſatiſfied of themſelues ſufficiently for their ſinnes, and thought that heauen was due vnto them for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt actions.</p>
            <p>Neither wanted there Monkes, and Friers, who <note place="margin">VVoorkes for to ſale.</note> would ſell their idle and ſuperfluous woorkes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation, if there were any that would redeeme them with monie. So much ſome men did attribute to their owne merites, and good woorkes. Yea, they knewe <note place="margin">The iuſtice of faith vnknowen.</note> almoſt no difference betwixte that righteouſneſſe of faith, whereof Saint Paule entreateth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and that politicall righteouſneſſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth the ciuil diſcipline of vertue, &amp; manners: which thing the bookes of our aduerſaries doe plainely, and openly teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Neither were they ſufficiently taught heretofore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">The abrogation of the lawe vnknowen.</note> the abrogation of the lawe: neither could they once vnderſtande, or ſuſpect, by what meanes wee are deliuered from the execration, and curſe of the lawe, by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Neither knewe they ſufficiently that diſtinction of a feigned, and deade faith, which Saint Iames teſtifieth <note place="margin">The iuſtifying faith vnknowen.</note> to bee the faith of diuelles: and of the true and liuely faith, which thou maiſt call (if thou wilt) both the Euangelicall, and the iuſtifying faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine termeth the faith of Chriſt, and the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian grace.</p>
            <p>For, as often as they heard faith named, they dreamed that it was either that naked, &amp; bare hiſtoricall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things comprehended in the Scriptures, or elſe the profeſsion of religion: they were vtterly ignorant
<pb facs="tcp:185160:27"/>
of that aſſured truſt of Gods grace, and of remiſsion of <note place="margin">A definition of the true Chriſtian faith.</note> our ſinnes, and of the mercie promiſed for Chriſts ſake, which one onely faith is in deed the true Chriſtian faith, by which we both call vpon God, and boldly approche, and come vnto him: and finally, haue peace with God <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</note> through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
            <p>Neither heretofore knewe they any difference of <note place="margin">Difference of woorkes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.</note> woorkes: yea, they reuerenced as much both the rites founde out by men, and alſo that childiſh Paedagogie of ceremonies, as they did the woorkes preſcribed by Gods lawes, and thoſe woorkes, which are neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Neither could they iudge what difference there was <note place="margin">Difference of ſinne vnknowen heretofore.</note> betwixt veniall, and mortall ſinne. Neither knewe they in what point the kingdome of Chriſt differed from the Popiſhe common weale, or the true Church from the falſe Church. Neither knewe they what difference there was betwixt faſting, and choyce of meates.</p>
            <p>Finally, they thought that by Gods lawe onely the <note place="margin">The true vſe of Gods lawe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.</note> outward factes, and that ciuil iuſtice were required they ſawe not, that the whole, and moſt perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the heart towardes God was exacted, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs. So by that meanes they ſtoode in great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the vaine ſhadowes, and ſimilitudes of good woorkes, they did not beholde the ſolide, and expreſſe image, and picture of true righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>It remained now, that we ſhould bring foorth more matter concerning the abuſe of ceremonies (of which by the way I haue ſaied ſomewhat before) concerning the impure ſingle life of Prieſtes, concerning the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, hypocriſie, and tyrannie of the mendicant, or begging Friers, to be briefe, of Pharaſaiſme in the Frie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Monaſteries, of Epicuriſme in the Collegies of Canons, of Iudaiſme in Eccleſiaſticall rites, of Paganiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the life and manners of the Chriſtians of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

age, of ſo many ſnares of mens conſciences, of the feigned miracles of Saintes, &amp; almoſt ſixe hundred ſuch like deuiſes. But I hope that euerie man will by theſe few, which we haue ſpoken of, eaſily coniecture the reſt which remaine, which are very many. For as I ſuppoſe, I haue ſhewed ſufficiently, what hath bene the ſtate of Chriſtianitie now of late yeares, and many ages paſt, and I haue declared what ſuperſtitions, what faultes, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes haue crept into the Church.</p>
            <p>I beſeech God, the father of our Lorde and Sauiour <note place="margin">A godlie prayer</note> Ieſus Chriſt, that as he hath reſtored the light of his Goſpell to thoſe, which heretofore were compaſſed with the thicke cloudes of errours, ſo he woulde open the eyes of the aduerſaries of the Goſpell, that they may be conuerted from darkeneſſe to light, from the power of Sathan to God: finally, from the vaine ſuperſtition of their aunceſtours, and forefathers, to the worſhippe of true godlineſſe, Amen.</p>

Firſt therefore it is plaine, and euident to all men at this day, that from the beginning of the worlde, till now, there hath alwayes beene one and the ſame way to obteine ſaluation by: namely, by the ſole, and onely truſt and confidence in Chriſt, whome the godly did beleeue ſhould come as the Sauiour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Adam, and to the old fathers, euen from the originall of the worlde: whom we now beleeue to be come alreadie at a determinate time, and to haue brought ſaluation vnto mankinde. For our faith alſo at this day is the very ſame with the faith of the Patriarchs, Prophetes: and finally, of the whole people of Iſrael in <note place="margin">Our faith and the faith of the Patriarches is all one.</note> times paſt, becauſe they expected, and wayted for that to come, which we doe beleeue to be alreadie done. Now, though we conceiue in our mindes, that the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Patriarches was exceeding greate (whiche without all doubte was ſingular, and moſt notable) <note place="margin">The ſanctitie of the old Patriarches.</note> notwithſtanding, they were ſaued by no other meanes, but by faith in the Redeemer of mankinde, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them, now exhibited to vs, who is the ſonne of God, our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. So that the
<pb facs="tcp:185160:28"/>

Therefore all men muſt looke for ſaluation from this one, and onely Chriſt: neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men any other name giuen (as S. Peter ſaith) <note place="margin">

            <p>Seeing theſe things are ſo, who would not maruell <note place="margin">The blindeneſſe of the Papiſtes.</note> much at the blindneſſe of the Chriſtians both in our memorie, and in former ages, which did attribute that to mans merites, which is due vnto Chriſt alone. For that can not bee denied, which we haue before declared more at large, to witte, that mortall men did not heretofore truſt ſo much to the goodneſſe, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, bountie, mercie, and grace of GOD alone, nor ſo much to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt onely for our ſinnes, as they did to the dignitie, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of their owne woorkes. For whitherto tend <note place="margin">Truſt and confidence.</note> ſo many rites, and formes of woorſhipping GOD: found out, and ordeined by men, ſo many will woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes, ſo many fraternities, ſo manifold varietie of Maſſes, moreouer Pilgrimages, Pardons, a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall life, voluntarie beatings, and alſo whippinges of our owne bodie, hungers, watchinges, lyinges vppon the bare ground, and who can rehearſe all? Whereto (ſay I) doe wee beleeue that all theſe thinges did tend, but to the obteining of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, to the ſatisfaction for offences, to the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from eternall death: briefly, to the obteining of ſaluation, and bleſſedneſſe? So now men aſcribed their ſaluation not to the ſonne of God our Lord, &amp; Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ieſus Chriſt, who by his owne bloudſhed ſatisfied
<pb facs="tcp:185160:29"/>
for the ſinnes of the worlde, and pacified the wrath of God: but to the worthineſſe of their owne woorkes, and to their owne merites, and vertues.

Neither doe we <note place="margin">Our beſt deedes are ſtained and cainted.</note> that onely, but alſo wee declare, that euen our verie good deedes (if there be any) are not pure, ſound, and ſincere: but that they are alwayes polluted with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine mixture of vice: that they are not true, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, but as it were ſhadowed and coloured: that finally, they are not perfect, or abſolute in euerie point, but vnperfect, and ſcarſe begonne: and we doe make it plaine, how farre off we are from the excellencie of that righteouſneſſe, which God requireth of vs, of which our righteouſneſſe may ſeeme to bee ſcarſe a certeine image, or a printe lightly ſtamped, that I may not ſay
<pb facs="tcp:185160:30"/>
a picture, or ſhadowe of it: and ſo at the length, wee ſette before ſinners both the wrath and iudgement of God, and the torments of Hell, wee terrifie the guiltie, wee accuſe them, wee conuince them, we condemne them: &amp; now they being thus brought almoſt to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and in an inward trembling for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their ſinnes, fearing ſeriouſly that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they haue deſerued, and being amazed, &amp; beaten downe with the feare of hell fire (which thing to doe is the chiefe office of the Lawe) by &amp; by we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte <note place="margin">The Goſpell ioyned with the lawe.</note> them with a godlie conſolation: and in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and anguiſhes of minde, in this feeling of the wrath of God, in this taſt (as it were) of eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wee bidde thoſe men, which are ſo terrified, and which haue bewayled their ſinnes, to flee, as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuppliantes, vnto the exceeding greate mercie of God, through Chriſt, to aske pardon for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to pray that GOD woulde forgiue them: that thing is done by preaching the Goſpell. It is <note place="margin">In our ſermons we muſt chiefly note ſecrete ſinnes, becauſe of Hypocrites.</note> truely maruellous harde, though verie neceſſarie, (which thing in former ages hath bene neglected) ſo to lay open, thoſe hidden and inwarde ſinnes, ſo to diſcloſe that wickedneſſe of mans minde and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe of mans hearte, which Hypocrites doe not ſee at all, being couered as it were with certeine vailes of pride, and ſelfe loue, ſo to bring to light that malice, throughly faſtened in our corrupt nature, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, acknowledging his diſeaſe, may bee carefull to ſeeke for a remedie, may labour to flee vnto Chriſt in feruent deſire to reconcile Gods will, and may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that this Chriſt onely hath by his death ſatiſfied for the ſinnes of all men. Neither doe I make ſo many woordes of this matter raſhly, and vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly <note place="margin">Few Papiſts haue knowen what ſinne is.</note> for naught. For hitherto there haue bene fewe in the Popes kingdome which could either vnderſtand
<pb facs="tcp:185160:31"/>
them ſelues, or teach others truely what was ſinne. Which thing the matter it ſelfe doth plainly ſhewe to be true. For as they accompted thoſe heinous, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt offences, which the lawes did publikely puniſh, to be ſinnes: ſo they made nothing of that homebred vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſitie, and of that natiue ſpot, and corruption of ours: neither did they acknowlege their owne deceitfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, and (to vſe S.

               </note> their owne heartes, by ſearching diligently all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt turninges, &amp; ſecreat corners of their owne minde: neither did they ſee ſufficiently their owne vaine hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, or their vices, which deceiued them with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine ſhewe of a feigned vertue. Yea, &amp; often times they, <note place="margin">Papiſtes careleſſe to obſerue Gods preceptes, but carefull to keepe mans preſcriptes.</note> which woulde ſoone neglect the commaundements of God, did carefully keepe, and obſerue the preſcripts of men: and they which were not greatly greeued with the neglect of them, ſorrowed ſundrie times verie much for the violation, and breach of theſe. For what an hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence was it accompted, yea almoſt a matter of <note place="margin">Eating of flesh in the Lent.</note> life and death, if a man in the Lent (as they call it) had bene ſo bold, as to eate egges, and fleſh? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie parte, what a light trifle, and what a ſmall ſinne was enuie, debate, hatred, ſpitefulneſſe, auarice, riot, dronkenneſſe, whoredome, and ſuch like thought to <note place="margin">Papiſtes punish more grieuouſly the tranſgreſſours of mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than the breakers of Gods lawes: ſo doe they vſe to correct ſinne and wickedneſſe.</note> bee? Which thing thou maiſt eaſily coniecture by this, for that theſe were ſtreight way remitted to him that confeſſed his faulte by any ſacrificing Prieſt, and for that there were verie light puniſhments appointed for them: but the other were not forgiuen but by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, or by thoſe onely, which bare the greateſt ſway in the Church. So, that which was committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lawe of God, was eaſily pardoned: but that which was done againſt the preſcripts of men was verie <note place="margin">The neglect of ſinging in the Church.</note> hardly forgiuen, and that not by euerie man. So the neglect of ſinging vpon an holie day in the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:31"/>
what a ſinne was it reckoned? But forgetfulnes of God in proſperitie, ingratitude towards God, &amp; other ſuch like ſinnes, how were they nothing accompted of? I could bring forth well nigh ſixe hundred ſuch, but that I thinke that this, which I haue rehearſed, is inough for example ſake. Notwithſtanding, I will yet relate one or two more, that thereby the whole matter may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare. If the ſacrificing Prieſt had by chaunce any <note place="margin">The neglect of mumbling vp Mattins.</note> day omitted his houres of prayer, how great a ſinne was that thought to bee, how ſcarſe pardonable? That the ſame man did keepe a concubine, that the ſame man did wholy abandon him ſelfe to bankettes, to wine, &amp; to lecherie, in that there was no man, which was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended.</p>
            <p>So, if a Monke had not orderly inough finiſhed his <note place="margin">The ſuperſtition of Monkes in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their Ceremonies.</note> ceremonies, good God what trembling &amp; quaking was there? what anguiſh of minde? finally, what feare, leſt hee ſhould fall into hell? But for the ſame man to beare priuie grudges againſt his brethren, for to detract from other mens fame, and good name, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted <note place="margin">The ſuperſtitious obſeruing of an holie day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Papiſtes.</note> no offence. If any man vpon an holy day had done any woorke in the fielde, the buſineſſe requiſite to bee done, what an heinous offence? what an inexpiable crime was it iudged? But hee that, neglecting the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, had ſpent the ſame day wholy in feaſtes, riottous and reueling bankets, in wine, in ſurfeting, in danſing, in dicing, in paſtimes, and ſometime in bralles, and fightinges, he verely was thought to haue made a faire dayes woorke, and to haue kept holy day verie well, and deuoutly. So, if the Biſhop ſhoulde haue made a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">VVhom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes woulde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte to take ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie orders, as they call them.</note> man Miniſter, though hee were a godly, and a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, he accompted it a wicked act, becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the canons, and rules of their order, though it be permitted by Gods lawes. But the ſame man is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all affraid, to chooſe into the number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:32"/>
and Prelates, much more into the number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſtes, I doe not ſay now dronkardes, couetous caytifes, and angrie wretches, but beſides their extreme ignorance, inceſtuous perſons, homicides, parricides, Church robbers, dicers, ſorcerers, that I may adde no woorſe, although the holie Ghoſte by the mouth of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.

            <p>So verely the Iewes thought it a curſed and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">How ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Iewes obſerued their Sabboth day.</note> deed, to pull an Oxe out of a dich vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day: but that Chriſt by ſpeaking the woorde did heale men vpon that day, that verely they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vnto him as the greateſt crime that coulde bee. And they that made a religion of it, to enter the Iudgement hall, namely, to the end they might <note place="margin">

            <p>Now after that the man hath truely acknowledged <note place="margin">They which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their owne ſinnes how they are to be comforted.</note> his ſinnes, &amp; being moued thereto by repentance, hath ſorrowed greatly in mind for them, &amp; hath trembled at the anger, &amp; iudgment of God againſt them, &amp; ſighing from the bottome of his hearte, hath aſpired, &amp; deſired the grace of Chriſt, wee will him to hope well, and to be of good cheere: we comfort him being ſad, &amp; ſorrowfull, by propoſing, &amp; ſetting before him the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, &amp; greate goodneſſe of God, who is woont eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to graunt pardon to the penitent, &amp; to haue reſpect to the contrite in ſpirit, and to him that trembleth at his ſayinges.

                  </gap> mercie through Chriſt.</note> dependeth on the only mercie of God through Chriſt: that Chriſt hath ſatiſfied GOD by his death for
<pb facs="tcp:185160:32"/>
the ſinnes of all men, and that hee by his puniſhment hath ſuffered that puniſhment, which wee did owe to the iuſtice of God: that Chriſt came into the <note place="margin">Chriſtes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites how they are to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to penitent ſinners.</note> worlde to ſaue ſinners: that Chriſt gaue him ſelfe the price of redemption for all: that Chriſt was wounded for our iniquities, and broken for our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe: that by Chriſt we were reconciled, when wee were Gods enimies: that by Chriſt wee are deliuered from the wrath of GOD: that by Chriſtes bloude we are all cleanſed from our ſinnes: that Chriſt doth daily make interceſsion for vs at the right hande of God his father: that by Chriſt wee are both ſanctified, and are the ſonnes of God, and haue life euerlaſting. Hitherto tendeth that which our Sauiour ſaith in Iohn: So GOD loued <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 16.</note> the worlde (ſaith hee) that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhoulde not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. For GOD ſent not his ſonne into the worlde, that he ſhoulde condemne the worlde, but that the worlde through him might bee ſaued. Hitherto alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth that of S. Iohn: Herein the loue of GOD <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 9. 10.</note> appeared towardes vs, becauſe GOD ſent his onely begotten ſonne into this worlde, that wee might liue through him. Herein is that loue manifeſt, not that wee loued GOD, but that hee loued vs, and ſent his ſonne to bee a reconciliation for our ſinnes. Hitherto alſo belongeth that, which S. Paule wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Epheſians, and to the Coloſsians: By whome <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 14.</note> (ſaith hee) wee haue redemption through his bloude, euen the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, according to the riches of his grace. And to the Corinthians: For alſo our Paſſeouer (ſaith hee) is offered vp for vs, euen Chriſt, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</note> And againe: For he which was without ſinne, made hee ſinne (that is the price of ſinne) for vs, that wee might <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:185160:33"/>
bee made the righteouſneſſe of God by him. I will not ſtande any longer in theſe teſtimonies of Scripture. For the ſumme of all is this, That GOD, through <note place="margin">The ſumme of the former doctrine.</note> Chriſt, is reconciled vnto vs, and that Chriſt hath ſatiſfied the iuſtice of God for the ſinnes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>This faith therefore is conceiued by the preaching <note place="margin">How faith is conceiued by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell.</note> of the Goſpell. For the Goſpell, ſetting downe the reconciliation of God through Chriſt, and the ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt for the ſinnes of men, doth ſhew forth hope of ſaluation, and an aſſured confidence to them that repent.</p>
            <p>After this ſorte, which you haue hearde, doe wee comforte him, which is greeued for his offences, and ſorrowfull for his ſinnes. For wee ſpeake not a woorde to him of Romiſh indulgencies, of Pilgrimages, of Monkes ſuffragies, and other ſuch like trifles. We doe againe, and againe inculcate, and beate into his braine, which is repentant for his ſinnes, Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Chriſt onely hath done the deeds for vs.</note> ſo as the Scripture teacheth. We declare that it is Chriſt alone, whome wee ought to vſe as our Spoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſman, Attourneie, and Sollicitour, in appeaſing God: that Chriſt is hee alone, who both by the ſacrifice of his bodie hath ſatiſfied for the ſinnes of mankind, and in whoſe onely bloud and merites, all mortall men ought to repoſe the whole truſt of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And that there may not remaine any little ſcruple in <note place="margin">The vſe of the Euangelicall abſolution.</note> the conſcience of the ſinner, wee exhorte him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the Miniſter of the Church, &amp; confeſsing with an humble, and lowlie mind his ſinnes, to deſire of him ſincerely, and from his heart with grones, weeping, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, teares, and with ſighes, abſolution, (as our men tearme <note place="margin">The keyes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Church.</note> it,) and the comforte of the Goſpell. We ſhewe what keyes of the kingdome of heauen Chriſt hath left
<pb facs="tcp:185160:33"/>
vnto his Churche, that the Churche hath committed thoſe to the Miniſters of Gods worde: that it ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that Chriſt himſelfe by the Miniſter of the Church doeth reſtore man to Gods mercie and fauour, by the Miniſter doeth comfort with the word of God the afflicted conſcience, doeth raiſe it being fallen and caſt downe, doeth ſtrengthen it ſtaggering: finally, by the Miniſter doeth now after abſolution ſend him away with a pacified, and quiet minde. For hitherto tendeth that which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith in S. Iohns Goſpell: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20. 23.</note> Whoſoeuers ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted. For, we muſt not thinke that abſolution is any other thing, but <note place="margin">Abſolution what it is.</note> the voyce of the Goſpell, ſounding by the Miniſter of the Church, by which that forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Goſpell to the penitent, is particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to euerie ſeuerall man. Therefore wee ought to heare the voyce of the Miniſter abſoluing vs, and to reſt with our whole mindes contented with it, no leſſe than to hearken either to the voyce of Chriſt preſent, who is truely our Biſhop, and high Prieſt (as the authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues ſaith) or to the voyce of God himſelfe ſpeaking from heauen. For Chriſt in Saint <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 15.</note> Markes Goſpell commaundeth vs not onely to repent, but alſo to beleeue the Goſpell, that is, the preaching of remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Now, to the ende that this confidence of obteining <note place="margin">The penitent perſon muſt come often to the Lordes ſupper.</note> pardon of ſinnes may be increaſed with a certeine heape as it were, and that in this weakeneſſe of our mindes, &amp; proneneſſe to diſtruſt, it may be by all meanes on euerie ſide bolſtered vp, vnderpropped and ſtrengthened, we will the partie to be preſent at the Lordes Supper, and to eate (ſo as Chriſt inſtituted, and ordeined it) the bodie of Chriſt, which was a ſacrifice on the altar of the Croſſe for the ſinnes of men: and to drinke his bloud, which was ſhead for the purgation, and ſatiſfaction of ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

For as faith is firſt conceiued by the worde of the <note place="margin">Faith is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> Goſpell, concerning the promiſe of grace, &amp; remiſsion of ſinnes, ſo the ſame is ſtirred vp, erected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Sacrament: as Saint Auguſtine teſtifieth verie well: <hi>Sacramentum eſt quaſi verbum viſibile,</hi> A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> is as it were a viſible worde: becauſe that as <note place="margin">Faith is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Sacrament.</note> faith is conceiued, and bredde in vs, by the hearing of the worde, ſo the ſame faith is confirmed and ratified by this externall, and viſible ſigne.

            <p>Now, after that the penitent is mindfull of the Lords <note place="margin">VVhat is to be done after the receiuing of the Lordes ſupper.</note> death, which death was a ſatiſfaction for the ſinnes of the whole worlde, we bidde him both to giue thankes from his heart to Ieſus Chriſt for his exceeding great benefites towardes vs, for that hee offering vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for vs, hath appeaſed Gods diſpleaſure, and for that he hath ſuffered the puniſhmentes in his owne bloud, which wee by the iuſtice of God ſhoulde haue felte (of which thing this myſticall Supper is extant in the Churche as a perpetuall ſigne, and monument:) and alſo wee will him to ſing merily and ioyfully hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or ſongs of praiſe, vnto the ſame Ieſus Chriſt, with a gratefull minde, both with himſelfe at home priuately, and alſo in the Churche with the aſſemblie of the faithfull publikely, and to giue him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe and honour, which worthily he oweth vnto him: finally, to liue godly, and holily, and in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine

For to them which are iuſtified by <note place="margin">1. <hi>The.</hi> 2. 12.</note> faith in Chriſt, after a true, and earneſt repentance for their ſinnes, which now verely bringeth with it another kinde of life, &amp; which requireth other manners, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Gods law is then neceſſarie, to the end they <note place="margin">Obedience of Gods lawe is neceſſarie to the true penitent.</note> may now glorifie God with honeſt actions, and godlie workes, that they may adorne the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and that they may offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, through Ieſus Chriſt.

the godlie, and the faithfull, although (as I ſaid) they haue not ſatiſfied the Lawe of God ſo perfectly, and fully, neither haue kept his commaundementes in euery parte, &amp; abſolutely.

made them an enſample vnto them that afterwardes ſhould liue vngodly, as Saint Peter ſaith in his ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle. Wee doe ſet before him not onely the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6.</note> wherewith God plagued Pharao, and the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians: but alſo the great calamities of the people of Iſrael, and their often captiuities vnder barbarous nations: neither doe we omitted either the deſtruction of the citie of Hieruſalem, or other innumerable ſuch like deſolations.

            <p>Moreouer, wee ſet downe before him certeine places out of the holy Scriptures (worthie to be remembred) which are fitte for this purpoſe, and amongeſt other ſayinges, that chiefly, whiche is in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes: He that deſpiſeth Moſes lawe, dieth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">

Of howe much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be worthie, which treadeth vnder foote the Sonne of God, and counteth the bloud of the Teſtament as an vnholie thing, wherewith he was ſanctified, and doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite the ſpirit of grace? And that ſaying out of the ſecond Epiſtle of Saint Peter: For, if they, after they <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</note> haue fledde backe from the filthineſſe of the worlde, through the acknowledging of the Lord, and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, are notwithſtanding yet againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein and ouercome, their latter end is worſe with them tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their beginning.

them, not to haue knowen the way of righteouſneſſe, than after they haue knowen it, to turne from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaundement geuen vnto them. Saint Peter ſpeaketh theſe wordes of thoſe men, who like as the dogge returneth to his owne vomite (as it is ſaied in the common Prouerbe) or, as the Sow that was waſhed, returneth to her wallowing in the mire: ſo they ſlide backe againe afreſhe into their ſinnes, and wickedneſſe. Wherefore by theſe, and ſuch like both examples, and threates of the Scripture, we goe about to terrifie, and call backe the repentant perſon from ſinne.</p>
            <p>Before all thinges we exhort him to ſee well to this, <note place="margin">VVe muſt not ſinne voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> that not onely he himſelfe doe not willingly, &amp; againſt his owne conſcience ruſh headlong into ſinne (for ſo he might looſe both faith, and the holy ſpirit, neither could he be in fauour with God:) or that he doe not pamper too much (as the common ſorte of men is woont to doe) the tenderneſſe of his minde: but alſo that with all might and maine he reſiſt, and withſtand Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <note place="margin">vve muſt reſiſt Sathan, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure vs.</note> mouing him to miſchiefe, that he alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware moſt diligently of the ſnares, and trappes which the diuell hath laide for him, that he yeelde not to him, that ſetteth pleaſure as an obiect before him, or to him which is deſirous to enſnare, and allure him with the inticementes of vices: finally, that he ſhunne all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cut off as it were the handles to ſinne.</p>
            <p>Neither, if he once happily obteine the victorie ouer his enimie, let him not by &amp; by hope for truce, &amp; peace, <note place="margin">vve can neuer haue anie truce with the Diuell.</note> as though he were paſt all perill, but let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he muſt alwayes ſtande in the forefront of the battell: neither, if he bee vanquiſhed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, let him deſpaire, nor if he bee victor, let him ſwell with any ſecrete pride.</p>
            <p>And let him verily enterpriſe al theſe things, not truſting
<pb facs="tcp:185160:41"/>
to his owne ſtrength, and power, but hauing his hope, and his whole aſſurance placed in Gods ayde and aſsiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and calling vppon the ſonne of God in godlie prayers for helpe. <note place="margin">VVe muſt often receiue the Lordes ſupper, by which our faith in Chriſt, and charitie towardes our neighbour is increaſed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane ſpace, in our Eccleſiaſticall meeting, wee warne him to repaire very often to the Lordes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: to the end that hee, by receiuing Chriſtes body, may both be ſtirred vp to the remembrance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and alſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med concerning Gods good will, and celeſtiall fauour towardes him. For the holy Ghoſt doeth vſe this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as a meane, and as it were an inſtrument to raiſe vp in vs aſſured confidence in Chriſt, and loue towardes our neighbour. Now, as Baptiſme is a perpetuall ſigne of that free remiſsion of ſinnes, and of that reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Chriſtes ſake: ſo the Supper of the Lord doeth teſtifie, and witneſſe vnto vs, that thoſe benefits laſt and dure for euer at all times in the Church of Chriſt, and that they are not voyde, and of none effect ſtreightway, no not in very great, and greeuous falles, if ſo be wee, being touched with repentance, doe flee vnto the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great mercie of God for Chriſt, &amp; if we deſire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of our ſinnes, and that not without a feruent deſire, and ſtudie, to returne againe into fauour, and friendſhip with God, nor without a moſt firme purpoſe to amende our liues, and to keepe, and obſerue hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods Pawe. And truely, Chriſt would that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The ſupper of the Lorde is a pledge of Chriſtes loue towardes vs.</note> of his bodie, and bloude ſhould be a perpetuall monument, and pledge of his loue towards vs: namely, that wee, repenting from our hearte, may (after we haue receiued this pledge) ſtirre vp our faith, and be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that wee haue our ſinnes forgiuen vs for Chriſtes ſake, who offered vp him ſelfe for vs vpon the altar of his Croſſe a lambe immaculate, and vnſpotted, that wee by this aſſurance might comfort our ſelues, and might

raiſe vp, and holde vp our afflicted conſcience, that wee might giue thankes to God for ſo greate a benefite, &amp; that wee might declare this our thankfullneſſe towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des God in our whole life, &amp; in all our actions, and that wee might (as the Apoſtle ſaith) ſhew foorth the Lordes death perpetually: finally, that wee being put in minde by this pledge, may euery way boldely truſt, that wee are now the members of Chriſt, and that Chriſtes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites belong vnto vs. For this Sacrament was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">vvhy the ſupper of the Lorde was inſtituted.</note> inſtituted for this cauſe (as I ſaide before, but muſt ſay it oftener) that wee vſing it, might both exerciſe, and confirme our faith, and alſo that wee our ſelues might bee comforted with the remembrance, and memoriall of the Lordes death, which brought ſaluation to vs: &amp; that ſo at the length wee might giue that thankes to God, and to the ſonne of God, which wee doe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily owe vnto them.

            <p>Now verely in publike ſermons, in which heretofore <note place="margin">vvhat manner of ſermons the Popish ſermons were.</note> there hath bene almoſt no other thing woont to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of, than of mens traditions, of forged fables, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tales, and feigned miracles of Saintes, of vaine viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and apparitions of ſhadowes, of vowes, of Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, of indulgencies, and pardons, of offering vp a

            </p>
            <p>Alſo in the ſame Sermous (as likewiſe priuately, and in ſecret confeſsions) both the rude and ignorant are <note place="margin">The manner of our priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at this day.</note> taught, and inſtructed, and the vnwarie are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the ſlouthfull are rebuked, the forward are incited, the weaklinges are ſtrengthened, the afflicted are raiſed vp, thoſe that ſtraie, and wander out of the way, are brought in againe: they which are wholy diſpleaſed with them ſelues for the guilte of their ſinne are comforted, they which ſleepe ſecure in ſinne are terrified, and made affraide with threates: and (not to vſe many woordes) all men alike are pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forward to leade their life after the will, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God, all men are willed to thinke vpon death, hanging daily ouer our heades by reaſon of vncerteine chaunces, and to prepare them ſelues for that day, wherein they muſt departe this life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looſe the time of repentance giuen vnto them by the benefite of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in thoſe Sermons of our men, there are <note place="margin">VVhat kinde of doctors the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes doe cite in their ſermons.</note> not nowe woont to bee alleadged, and cited I can not tell what ſolemne Doctours, there are quoted
<pb facs="tcp:185160:42"/>
none of theſe ſubtile, none of theſe Seraphicall, finally, none of theſe irrefragable Doctours: as, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Thomas Aquinas, Petrus Lombardus, Rabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Nicolaus de Lira, Dunſe, Dorbell, Occam, and other ſuch like, which heretofore were rife in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes mouthes: but now Moſes, the Prophets, Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and the Euangeliſtes, are cited, to <note place="margin">VVhat Doctors our Preachers doe alledge.</note> proue, and confirme the matter, which they doe there entreate of.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue our minde, and meaning: namely, what kinde of man wee at this day woulde haue him to bee, who profeſſeth him ſelfe to bee a Chriſtian not more in woorde, than in deede. You haue alſo a ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, comprehended verie briefly in fewe woordes, the verie ſame, which is taught amongſt vs: Whereby you may eaſily learne, what hath bene amended in Eccleſiaſticall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
            <p>Now wee will proceede to declare, what hath bene either chaunged, or quite taken away in Ceremonies: but firſt we will ſpeake ſomewhat of the Pope or Biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>All men (well nigh) heretofore, did beleeue as their <note place="margin">Of the Bishop of Rome.</note> Creede, that the Pope was by Gods lawe head of the Church. But wee after the iudgement of S. Paule doe affirme, that Chriſte alone is the head of the Church.</p>
            <p>For the place out of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 18.</note> of the Coloſsians is well knowen. Wee denie not this, that the Biſhop of Rome may, by the generall conſent of the other Biſhops, bee appointed as it were a certeine <note place="margin">How farre foorth the godlie may tolerate the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Bishop of Rome.</note> ſuperintendent, or ouerſeer of the Churches, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Chriſtian common weale, &amp; that hee may both bee, and alſo ſeeme to be, as it were a Cenſour of mens manners, &amp; a maiſter of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:43"/>
if ſo bee hee woulde vſe his authoritie graunted not to get any Lordſhip, or ſouereigntie ouer others, but to the profit of the Church: not to bring in ſuperſtition, but to eſtabliſh true religion, and if hee woulde throughly doe the duetie belonging to the function taken in hand: finally, if hee woulde bee bounde to certeine lawes of gouernement, neither would permit (as he hath done heretofore) that his owne luſt, and licence ſhould ſtand for a lawe. Our men verely hitherto haue made warre <note place="margin">How thoſe thinges are to be taken which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have bene either ſaide or written againſt the Pope.</note> onely with the Popes kingdome, and with the Romiſh ruledome, and with that power, which would aduance it ſelfe both aboue the Scripture, and the Church, and almoſt aboue God him ſelfe: neither ſeeme they to graunte vnto any mortall man whatſoeuer, as long as they can helpe it, to be able to doe more than the woorde of God, and the Church. Otherwiſe I knowe full well they will not refuſe the authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome, if hee will take paines to ſee that Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon bee inſtaured, that ſuperſtitions bee taken away, that the Churches bee reformed, that the manners of all eſtates bee corrected, and amended. And if that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Biſhop (which at the beginning was graunted for the better preſeruation of Chriſtianitie, &amp; of conſent in doctrine) had not bene turned into domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or rather tyrannie, our men truely would neuer haue bene perſuaded to haue violated, caſt off, and to haue baniſhed (as it were) out of the Church, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Therefore, no other man, but the Biſhop of Rome him ſelfe, is the cauſe, why that Apoſtolicall ſeate (as they call it) hath bene ſo deſpiſed: neither can the Biſhop accuſe any man for that matter more iuſtly than him ſelfe. <note place="margin">The intollerable arrogancie of the Pope deſcried in manie of his ſayinges and doings.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For who can thinke it tollerable, that hee ſhould call him ſelfe, The vniuerſall and Oicomenicall Biſhop, who hath the right to ordeine, and to confirme, to diſplace,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:43"/>
and remoue from their office all the Biſhops, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in the whole world? that hee doth arrogate vnto him ſelf the authoritie of making lawes concerning the ſeruice and woorſhip of God, concerning the chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Sacraments, concerning Eccleſiaſticall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? that hee doth thinke his owne decrees to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with Gods lawes, ſo that all mens conſciences are neceſſarily bounde to the obſeruing of them, if they will ſee to their owne ſaluation? that hee doth ſit in the Temple of God, as God: as S. Paule ſaith of Antichriſt, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. Antichriſt doeth ſitte in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of GOD, and doeth defende himſelfe and his doinges by the name of the Churche: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appeareth that the Turke cannot be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> and that hee doth take vnto him the right of chaunging the doctrine of Chriſt, and the woorſhippes appointed by God? that hee doth ſuffer him ſelfe to bee iudged of no man, and that hee doth preferre his owne authoritie before the iudgement of Councelles, and of the whole Chriſtian Church? that hee doth not ſuffer Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call controuerſies to bee decided rightly, and orderly, and that in Synodes hee doth not ſuffer any thing to be iudged, and concluded againſt his ſentence? that hee challengeth vnto him ſelfe the authoritie to tranſlate from one to an other both kingdomes and Empires? that hee ſticketh hard to this: how that by Gods lawe hee is Lord of all the kingdomes of the worlde? finally, that hee boaſteth how that hee is the Emperours law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſour, when the Empire is vacant: and that hee doth confirme this, howe that it is neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to beleeue it?

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:185160:44"/>
Wee verely doe nothing regarde that their carefull, <note place="margin">The abuſe of confeſsion.</note> curious, and ſcrupulous enumeration, or reckoning vp of their ſeuerall ſinnes, with all the cirumſtances pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to it: as what was done, with what minde, with whome, at what time, howe long, where, howe often, wherefore, howe much, howe farre foorth, with what reaſon, and other ſuch like: this wee reiect as both full of ſuperſtition, and alſo euerie way vnprofitable, and (as it were) a certeine ſnare, or rather a butcherie, and croſſe of miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>

For when as wee ſay, that wee are iuſtified by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <note place="margin">They which teach that we are iuſtified by faith onelie, doe not take away good woorkes, but onelie confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> wee doe not take away good deedes, or honeſt actions: but wee exclude confidence, and truſt in woorkes, and wee ſhut out mens merites, which ought to haue no place in the matter of iuſtification. But all men (almoſt) were heeretofore fully perſuaded, that theſe merites of men were of abilitie, and power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinnes, and to ſatiſfie for them: in ſo much that the Monkes would not freely communicate to others their woorkes of ſupererogation (which they had leſſe neede <note place="margin">vvorkes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation ſold for ſiluer.</note> of themſelues to their owne ſaluation:) but would ſet them to ſale at a price, if any man would redeeme them with monie.</p>
            <p>Therefore we, excluding mens merites, doe teache <note place="margin">The aſſurance of our ſaluation is in Chriſt onelie.</note> that all the truſt, and aſſurance of our ſaluation ought to bee put, and placed in the onely free mercie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of God for Chriſt, who gaue himſelfe an expiatorie ſacrifice for mankinde.</p>

And that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gratis,</hi> freely, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Freely.</note> verely the condition of dignitie and merite: the ſame we doe ſay with the Eccleſiaſticall fathers, <hi>Sola fide,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">By faith alone.</note> by faith alone: leaſt you ſhould thinke the mutation of the wordes to change the thing it ſelfe. Theſe things, as I ſuppoſe, are both ſo cleare, and euident, that they may be eaſily vnderſtood: &amp; alſo proued by our men with ſo firme teſtimonies, that they can by no meanes be refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For in ſumme, we teach this, that men obteine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <note place="margin">All mens ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſteth in the onelie merite of Chriſt.</note> of their ſinnes, and are iuſtified by the free fauour, &amp; mercie of God onely, promiſed for Chriſt our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſake, if ſo be they doe place the aſſured truſt of their ſaluation onely in Chriſt our propitiator &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and if ſo be they doe by faith embrace the merit of Chriſt, who by his pretious bloud ſatiſfied God for all mens ſinnes. For there is no man which can obteine ſaluation, but he which doeth by faith receiue, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend free remiſsion of ſinnes, offered of God for Chriſtes ſake, and which holdeth faſt this confidence vnto the end. Therefore we are iuſtified not through any dignitie, or worthineſſe of our woorkes, neither <note place="margin">vve are iuſtified freelie and by faith alone. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.</note> through our merites, and deſertes: but (as the Apoſtle ſaith) by the bloud of Chriſt: &amp; as the ſame Paule ſaith, freely, by the grace of God himſelfe through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which is in Chriſt Ieſus, whom God hath ſet forth a propitiator through faith by the meanes of his bloud, &amp;c. Hitherto tendeth that of S. Peter out of the Actes: By the grace (ſaieth he) of our Lorde Ieſus <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11.</note> Chriſt we doe beleeue that we ſhall be ſaued. To make an end: when as wee ſay that wee are iuſtified by faith <note place="margin">vvhat it is to be iuſtified by faith alone.</note> onely, wee meane no other thing, but that ſaluation is geuen vnto vs of Chriſt onely, and that this ſaluation is to be receiued, and taken hold on by faith alone, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it can not be applied vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:185160:47"/>
For, faith is (as it were) an inſtrument, or hande, by <note place="margin">Faith is as it were a hande.</note> which that ſaluation, which is offered, is receiued, and apprehended of vs. They which ſay that wee exclude repentance, Baptiſme, Chriſtes merite, and the grace <note place="margin">A ſlaunder of the aduerſarie.</note> of God, when wee make mention of faith alone, are verely vnworthie to whome we ſhould giue any anſwer. For wee are not diſpoſed to refell thoſe thinges whiche are manifeſtly falſe, nor to reproue ſo impudent a lye. Onely wee take away truſt in our owne merits, and wee ſignifie vnto all men, that the hope of our ſaluation <note place="margin">vve onely take away confidence in merites.</note> ought to be put in Gods goodneſſe, and clemencie promiſed to vs for Chriſtes ſake. Hitherto perteineth that of S. Ambroſe vnto Irinaeus: <hi>Nemo (inquit) glorietur in operibus, quia nemo factis ſuis iuſtificatur: ſed qui iuſtus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Saint Ambroſe.</note> 
               <hi>eſt, donatum habet, quia poſt lauacrum iuſtificatus eſt:</hi> that is: Let no man glorie in his woorkes, becauſe no man is iuſtified by his deedes: but he that is iuſt hath it by gift, becauſe hee is iuſtified after regeneration. It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith alone which deliuereth, and ſetteth vs free by the bloud of Chriſt: becauſe that hee is bleſſed (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) who hath his ſinnes remitted, and whoſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. Saint Auguſtine.</note> iniquitie is pardoned. Yea, and S.

And writing vnto Bonifacius hee ſaith thus: <note place="margin">Idem ad Bonifacium.</note> 
               <hi>Quantaelibet fuiſſe virtutis antiquos praedices iuſtos, non eos ſaluos fecit niſi fides Mediatoris, qui in remiſſionem peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſanguinem fudit,</hi> that is: For how great vertues ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou doeſt praiſe thoſe iuſt men of olde time, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaued them, but faith in the Mediatour, who ſhead
<pb facs="tcp:185160:48"/>
his bloud for the remiſsion of ſinnes, Theſe thinges ſaith S. Auſtine, ſpeaking of the holie fathers of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. But let vs proceede on to the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Papiſtes, aduerſaries to the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <note place="margin">An obiection of the Papiſtes.</note> now renewed, doe obiect vnto vs, that we attribute leſſe to good woorkes, than indeed is meete, &amp; conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: &amp; that they, being brought into contempt, are now altogether neglected: yea, and that good woorkes are indeed taken away, and that they are left onely in name. Let vs briefly anſwere to theſe obiections.</p>
            <p>Firſt and formoſt, albeit in the matter, and manner of <note place="margin">The anſweare.</note> iuſtification, wee attribute no parte, or parcell vnto our woorkes: (whiche thing we doe, leſt wee ſhoulde make mens merites the price, and ſatisfaction for ſinne, &amp; for eternall death:) notwithſtanding otherwiſe we doe not at all refuſe them.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that our Preachers ſpend ſo much labour, <note place="margin">How and to what end our Preachers exhort vs to good woorkes.</note> &amp; trauell in expounding, and making plaine the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. Hence it is, that as much as we may, wee exhort men to good woorkes: becauſe they doe ratifie, and teſtifie, our faith to be a true faith, and becauſe they declare our will to bee gratefull, and thankfull to God for his benefites, and becauſe they doe adorne, and ſet out the doctrine of the Goſpel, &amp; laſtly for that they inuite, &amp; ſtirre vp others to the ſtudie of <note place="margin">vvhy we muſt doe good woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> godlineſſe. Yet for all this, wee teach that they muſt be done, not through hope by them to ſatisfie for our ſinnes, or of a truſt to obteine righteouſneſſe by them: but either to the glorie of God, or to the vſe, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of our neighbour. Alſo wee ſhew that our faith is <note place="margin">Faith vnperfect without woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of loue.</note> maimed after a ſorte, and vnperfect, if no good deedes or dueties towards our neighbour followe. For faith (as S. Ambroſe ſaith) is the roote of all vertues: the foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teine, <note place="margin">Ambroſe. Auguſtine.</note> and welſpring of all good woorkes, as S. Auſtin ſaith: the mother of euerie good will, and iuſt action,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:48"/>
the Author of the booke, <hi>De vocatione Gentium,</hi> ſaith: the breeder, and bringer foorth of all right actions, as Chryſoſtome ſaith: the ſame faith is not idle, &amp; ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <note place="margin">Chryſoſtome.</note> but doing &amp; working alwayes, &amp; S. Paul ſaith to the Galathians it woorketh effectually by loue. Moreouer, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 6. There can be no true faith in thoſe which goe on ſtill in a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life.</note> wee denie that faith can bee, and abitle in that man, which liueth wickedly, and vngodly, and which obeyeth his luſtes, and yeeldeth to his concupiſcences againſt his owne conſcience. For we do iudge, that neither manſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor theeues, nor extortioners, nor adulterers, nor couetous miſers, nor proude perſons, nor dronkardes, and ſuch like fellowes, can (vnles they repent) haue any faith &amp; beleefe, that God the Father will be fauourable, <note place="margin">A purpoſe to ſinne cannot ſtande with a true faith.</note> and mercifull to them, through Chriſt. And wee teache (as our aduerſaries doe agree with vs) that theſe things, namely, the habite, purpoſe, and deliberation of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, are furtheſt off from a true faith. For he that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth wittingly, and willingly, that man without doubt contemneth, deſpiſeth, and nothing regardeth God. Now, ſuch contempt can in no wiſe agree with a firme faith, and ſtedfaſt truſt in God. And ſeeing that, as S. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 5.</note> Iohn witneſſeth, the beleeuers doe conquere, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe the worlde, and ſith that they, which perſeuere in vice and wickedneſſe, are thought not to beleeue: truly there can bee no true faith in ſuch, but perhaps a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine hypocriſie, and a certeine idle, and vaine dreame of faith, howſoeuer otherwiſe the aduerſaries of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine doe cry out againſt it: who, when as light is nowe reſtored vnto the worlde, had rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace darkeneſſe, than loue the light.</p>
            <p>But heere wee muſt obſerue, and note a difference <note place="margin">A diſtinction of woorkes. The firſt ſorte of woorkes are the ſuperſtitious woorkes of the Papiſtes.</note> betwixt good woorkes. For our aduerſaries doe ſay commonly, that almoſt thoſe onely are good woorkes, which wee haue rehearſed before, to witte, Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, woorſhipping of images, burning of Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:49"/>
and ſuch like odours, inuocation of Saintes, and ſuch like ioyned with impietie, and idolatrie, or els full of the greateſt follie, and madneſſe that may bee, and whiche God did not prepare that wee ſhoulde walke in them, as Saint Paule ſaith. Theſe woorkes wee doe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 10.</note> both flatly reprehende in woord, and remoue in deede.</p>
            <p>There are alſo beſides theſe other woorkes, good <note place="margin">The ſeconde ſorte of good woorkes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in bodilie exerciſe.</note> indeed, but yet ſuch as rather perteine to diſcipline, and to the exerciſe of the body, than to true godlineſſe: as, abſtinence from daintie meates, often faſtinges, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges, lying vppon the bare grounde, the neceſsitie of liuing according to the preſcript of man, and ſuch like: by whiche the fleſh is after a ſorte bridled, that it may not waxe wanton, and laſciuious, and that it may not exult too immoderately out of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Theſe woorkes wee very well like, &amp; allowe of, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee doe not eſteeme, and ſet ſo much by them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the vnſkilfull people was woont to doe: but wee doe farre preferre before theſe workes thoſe, which come neerer to true godlineſſe, of which wee will ſpeake hereafter. And verely the common people, if they ſee any men leane with hunger, broke with trauell, brought lowe with watching, doe much magnifie them for an opinion of holineſſe, &amp; by theſe things they doe eſteeme godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it ſeldome to paſſe, but very often, that <note place="margin">Manie are moued with the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewe of good woorkes.</note> men ſwell ſecretly in pride, and are puffed vp in minde about that externall hypocriſie of good woorkes, which ſo glorieth, &amp; boaſteth it ſelfe in the eyes of the people. Yea, thoſe ſame works are now &amp; then kept &amp; obſerued more ſuperſtitiouſly than needed, and well nigh with a Iudaicall mind, as if in theſe the greateſt godlineſſe that can bee did conſiſt: wheras indeed they bring ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite with them, vnleſſe thoſe true workes be in them to, which Chriſt inculcateth, &amp; beateth into the eares, and
<pb facs="tcp:185160:49"/>
mindes of his ſcholers. And it may be that hee which pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his bodie with faſting, which breaketh it with pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes taking, which corrupteth it with watching, which of his owne accorde abſtaineth for euer from wine and fleſh, which goeth in beaſtly &amp; beggerly apparell, which lieth vppon the bare grounde, which beareth heate and colde, it may be, I ſay, that he in the meane time is not farre eſtranged from ambition, from wrath, from enuie, from priuie grudges, &amp; hartburning, &amp; from other vices &amp; wickedneſſe, though by this hardneſſe, &amp; auſteritie of life he haue gotten him a great opinion of holineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men, &amp; though he wonderfully pleaſe him ſelf in theſe his outward workes: as in faſtinges, watchings, lyinges vpon the grounde, and in the obſeruation of ſuch like things, as did the whole companie of Monkes and Friers.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, there are woorkes very good and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall, <note place="margin">The thirde ſorte of good workes, which are good in deede.</note> which Chriſt inculcateth, which the doctrine of the Apoſtles commendeth, whiche the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes doe conteine.

if he flee, and auoyde all delicates, and dainties, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of whiche thinges was woont heeretofore to puffe vp the Monkes, with intollerable pride: but he onely is to bee thought to liue Chriſtianly, which ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth, <note place="margin">vvho liueth Chriſtianly.</note> and endeuoureth to declare, and manifeſt his faith to the worlde, by the laſt kinde of woorkes, that is to ſay: whiche repenteth perpetually, which feareth GOD truely, whiche loueth him vnfeignedly, whiche <note place="margin">vvorkes meete for the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> calleth vppon him in trouble, and aduerſitie, whiche giueth him thankes in proſperitie, which laudeth, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and confeſſeth God at all times, whiche is patient in miſeries, and calamities, which is modeſt in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie of this life, which is diligent in his duetie, which is temperate in his diet, &amp; apparell, which is iuſt, &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to his neighbor, which is bountifull to the poore, which tolerateth iniuries, which prayeth for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which curſe him, which beareth good will to them which owe ill will to him, which deſerueth well of them which hurt him, which feedeth the hungrie, which giueth drinke to the thirſtie, and the reſt which we haue rehearſed, which are truely and indeed good woorkes, and worthily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Chriſtian man.

            <p>This greeueth our aduerſaries ſore, that both wee flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiect the firſt kind of workes, &amp; alſo that we ſet not <note place="margin">Our aduerſaries are agrieued that we reiect the firſt and ſecond ſorte of woorkes.</note> ſuch ſtore by the ſecond ſort of workes, as the ignorant people are woont to doe, &amp; laſtly, that we inculcate the third kind of works oftner tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can bere, &amp; abide it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this alſo vexeth them, that wee had rather aſcribe our ſaluation to the free fauour, and mercie of <note place="margin">The Papiſtes are angrie with vs, for that we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only to Chiſt, and not to mans merites.</note> God for Chriſt, than vnto mens merites, &amp; good works, that wee condemne them, which put their truſt, and affiance in good deedes, whiche of them ſelues ſeeke to ſatiſfie for their owne ſinnes, whiche promiſe vnto
<pb facs="tcp:185160:50"/>
them ſelues for their woorkes, both deliuerance from eternall puniſhment, &amp; alſo bleſſed immortalitie: which thinke that heauen is due to their good deedes: and chiefly them, whiche are accuſtomed not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with other men freely their ouerflowing merites, but for ſiluer and gold readie told. Finally, they take it very greeuouſly, and in great ſnuffe, that wee doe teach <note place="margin">The Papiſtes are grieued that wee condemne their ſuperſtition and idolatie. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14.</note> (according to that precept of the Apoſtle: Flee the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of idols) that their manifeſt ſuperſtition, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and idolatrie in worſhipping of images, in calling vppon the dead, in the prophanation of the Supper of the Lorde, in the truſt of mens traditions, (wherein Monkerie wholy depended) ought to bee ſhunned, &amp; auoyded of all men.</p>
            <p>This verely is the cauſe why they cry out ſo much that good workes are indeed vtterly taken away, &amp; left only in worde &amp; name. Now, as oft as they crie out, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that religion is polluted, &amp; defiled, that rites, and ceremonies are violated, &amp; broken, that the woorſhip, &amp; ſeruice of God is neglected: ſo often they do not ſpeake of the third, &amp; laſt forte of workes, which we doe chiefly vrge, but either of the light toyes, &amp; fooliſh trifles of the firſt kinde of woorkes, which wee (as I ſaide before) vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiect: or of the labours, and exerciſes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde ſorte of woorkes, apperteining rather to a ſtraite diſcipline, than to ſincere godlineſſe, which exerciſes verely we doe not improue, and diſallowe, if ſo bee there bee no ſuperſtition, or other faulte in them, albeit wee accounte them woorthie to bee placed farre vnder the thirde kinde of woorkes, euen as Saint Paule warneth vs to doe. For vnto Timothie hee <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. 8</note> writeth thus: Exerciſe thy ſelfe vnto godlineſſe: for bodilie exerciſe profiteth little: but godlineſſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto all thinges. Now, although perhaps a few fonde fellowes ſpeake not warily, and wiſely enough,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:51"/>
of woorkes, the fault and blame of a fewe muſt not be <note place="margin">There are and haue alwayes bene ſome vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete Preachers which haue not ſpoken wiſely and diſcreetly y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of good woorkes.</note> laide vpon all. For euen in S.

thoſe vices, ſhall euer be heires of Gods kingdome.</p>
            <p>Nowe, that I may make an end of this confutation <note place="margin">The Papiſtes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vs vniuſtly as deſtroyers of good woorkes.</note> concerning woorkes, it appeareth plainly what notable iniurie they doe vnto vs, which ſay that we attribute leſſe to good woorkes than is meete, and conuenient: and which for that cauſe call vs haters of all good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, fighters, and warriours againſt good woorkes, yea, verie hangmen of good woorkes. For albeit we doe not inculcate thoſe monaſticall, &amp; flat ſuperſtitious workes, <note place="margin">Monkes woor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.</note> to wit, filthie attire, hatred of wedlock, choyce of meats, babling of prayers (as Chriſt calleth it,) vowes, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, <note place="margin">

            <p>And we ſhew verely that that ſame may be done, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">vvhat it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the worlde, and to renounce the Diuell.</note> not if thou thruſt and ſhroude thy ſelfe into ſome wilderneſſe, and hide thy ſelfe cloſe in a Monaſterie, which in old time was a foule fault, and a great errour: not if thou voluntarily ſeeke, and procure thine owne harme, and cruelly afflict thine owne body: finally, not if thou caſt away of thine owne accord, and refuſe thoſe goodes, and poſſeſsions, which thou haſt, nor by any ſuch meanes. How then I pray you? If thou take it well in woorth whatſoeuer God doth vnto thee, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he dealeth with thee: if thou doeſt vſe thy wealth, and all thy riches, with thankeſgiuing, when thou haſt them, and canſt willingly be content to want them, as oft as God taketh them from thee. If thou doe neither procure voluntarily thine owne vexations, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, nor refuſe calamities and ſorrowes ſent of God: if thou neither deſpaire in aduerſitie, nor be inſolent and proude in proſperitie: if both thou liue contented with thy preſent ſtate, and alſo omitte the carking care for thinges to come: if thou neither murmur, and grudge

at the griefe of ill things, nor loath, and miſlike the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of good things: if thou haſt monie, ſo that thou put no truſt in it, that thou ſpend it in godlie vſes, that thou be neither ſorie for the loſſe of it, nor be puffed vp with the abundance of it: not to vſe many wordes, if thou alwayes beare and ſuffer with one, and the ſame minde, and countenance, (how ſoeuer it ſhall ſeeme good vnto almightie God,) riches, pouertie, ſcarſitie, plentie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, penurie, glorie, ignominie, honor, diſhonor, loſſe, gaine, health, ſickneſſe, and ſuch like, whether they bee hard or ſofte, ſharpe and ſowre, or pleaſant and ſweete: and if thou giue thankes to the Lorde alwayes for all thinges, both gladſome, and ſorrowfull thinges, howſoeuer matters fall out, ill or well. This is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to renounce, and forſake the world truely, this is truely to addict, and conſecrate himſelfe wholy to God, this is truely to renounce Sathan the prince of the world.</p>
            <p>Hitherto alſo perteine theſe, to be farre from pride, from auarice, from exceſſe, from ambition, from vaine glorie, from hatred, from enuie, from deſire of reuenge, and from ſuch like affections, which are repugnant, and contrarie to the ſpirit of Chriſt.

<pb facs="tcp:185160:52"/>
watchings, &amp; carefulneſſe, to the amplifying of Gods praiſe, &amp; to the ſuccouring, &amp; releeuing of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, in any thing thou canſt doe: &amp; in the meane time to aſcribe, and arrogate nothing to thine owne ſtrength, neither to deſpiſe other men as ſinners, but both to acknowledge thine owne imbecillitie, and alſo to truſt onely to Gods fauour, and clemencie. Thus you haue heard what woorkes we doe inculcate, and beate into the eares, and mindes of men.</p>
            <p>They finde great fault with vs for this, that we teach, that it is a good woorke to ſweepe the pauement, or <note place="margin">The Papiſtes finde great faulte with vs, for that we call that a good woorke, whiche euerie man doeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in his vocation.</note> floore, to hew downe trees, or to cleaue wood, and ſuch like, ſith that the Ethnikes alſo, and Pagans doe that. As though it bee not a good woorke, though it ſeeme a baſe, and contemptible labour, whatſoeuer a man doth according to Gods commaundement, in his office, and trade of life.</p>
            <p>Therefore that ſeruant, which at his maiſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement heweth wood, and the drudge, or kitching ſlaue, which carrieth out of doores all the filth in the houſe, doeth verely a worke no leſſe acceptable to God, than he which preacheth, prayeth, and ſingeth. And <note place="margin">vvhat woorkes pleaſe God, and what diſpleaſe him.</note> why ſo? becauſe looke whatſoeuer God him ſelfe hath commaunded to bee done, he doeth well accept it: as contrarily he refuſeth, and reiecteth thoſe thinges, concerning which he neuer gaue commaundement in any place.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, this muſt bee beaten into the eares, and mindes of all men, (which our aduerſaries are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to blame vs for,) that euerie man endeuour to defend duely, &amp; to doe rightly, that office &amp; function which he beareth. And wherefore, I pray you, ſhould a maide, preparing her maiſters dinner, or making beds, leſſe pleaſe God, than a ſacrificing, or Maſſe Prieſt, which mumbleth vp his Mattins, or hourlie prayers, ſeing that
<pb facs="tcp:185160:53"/>
ſhee doeth obey Gods commaundement, whereas hee only obeyeth mens preſcript? Yea, that I may vrge them more: If a ſeruing man, being commaunded of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <note place="margin">The dreſſing of an horſe, how farre foorth it is a good woorke.</note> (who is to ride a ſoudeine, and a neceſſarie iournie,) to dreſſe his horſe, and to make him readie, would in the meane ſeaſon be preſent either at ſeruice, or at the Sermon, muſt hee not be thought to doe yll? For howe could hee well doe it, ſith that he ought not to refuſe to doe his maiſters will in thoſe matters, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Gods preceptes, as S. Paule in his Epiſtle <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18.</note> to the Epheſians, Coloſsians, and to Titus and S. Peter in his former Epiſtle teacheth? If hee therefore doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, as we muſt confeſſe: why ſhoulde any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne thoſe woorkes, whiche our aduerſaries affirme that the very Ethnikes doe, hauing but nature for their guide? It appeareth I wis how litle or nothing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian matters they vnderſtand, who dare reiect, &amp; make no account of the woorkes of godlie men, whih albeit they are to the ſhew, vile and abiect, they are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding commaunded of God. Who can denie but that <note place="margin">How farre foorth it is a good woorke to be at a ſermon.</note> it is an excellent, and a not able woorke, to be at a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? And yet for all that a baſer, and a more abiecte woorke muſt be preferred before it, to witte, the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of an horſe, if neede ſo require. So the whole reaſon is altered and changed, that looke what the Ethnikes alſo doe by natures lore, that ſame muſt be preferred before that which Chriſtians onely doe.</p>
            <p>How much rather doe you thinke that to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before thoſe ambitious woorkes which are done before mens eyes, and which vaunte, and boaſte them ſelues in mens ſight, ſuch as are theſe, Monaſticall feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">VVoorkes which Monkes bragge and boaſt of.</note> of pouertie, beaſtlie garmentes, long and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faſtes, prayers of Maſſe Prieſtes, and ſonges in the Church, whiche they doe not vnderſtand, voluntarie rentinges and manglinges of their bodie, and ſuch like?
<pb facs="tcp:185160:53"/>
Therefore, how fooliſhly doe they, yea how childiſhly are they wiſe, or rather fooliſh, which prefer rites found out by men, not ceremonies inſtituted by God, before the dueties of men, which walke (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) in their vocation and calling? Howe much better, I pray you, is it, and more agreeable to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if euerie man doe his duetie in that kind, &amp; trade of life, wherein hee is limited, &amp; that in the meane time hee neither preferre him ſelfe before others, nor deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe other mens woorkes, though they bee baſe, nor thinke that they are leſſe to bee ſet by, and leſſe to be eſteemed than his?</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Papiſtes obiect vnto vs ſo many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies <note place="margin">An other obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</note> euerie where abroad, ſaying, that this renewed doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine hath bene the cauſe, and occaſion of them.

            <p>Hee which liueth ſecure, and careleſſe, nor thinketh vpon the amendment of his life, heareth this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Bee yee alſo prepared therefore: becauſe

the Sonne of man will come at an houre, when ye <note place="margin">

And againe: Bee yee ſober, and watch, becauſe your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</note> the Diuell, as a roaring Lion, walketh about, ſeeking whome hee may deuoure. Hee that is a whore-maiſter, an adulterer, or defiled with the like ſinne, and wickedneſſe, heareth this ſaying: Neither whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, neither adulterers, nor vncleane perſons, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9.</note> ſhall inherite the kingdome of God. And againe: For this yee knowe, that no whoremonger, neither vncleane <note place="margin">

And againe: This is the will of God, to wit, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 3.</note> your ſanctification, that you abſteine from fornication. And: For to auoyde fornication let euerie man haue his <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4.</note> wife. Item: Marriage is honourable among all, and the bed vndefiled: but whoremongers, and adulterers God will iudge. And againe: Flee fornication: Euerie <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18.</note> ſinne that a man doeth, is without the bodie: but hee that committeth fornication, ſinneth againſt his owne bodie.</p>
            <p>Hee that paſſeth ouer the dueties of charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes our neighbour heareth this ſaying, Depart from mee yee curſed into enternall fire, which is prepared for the Diuell, and his Angels. For I was hungrie, and <note place="margin">

To bee briefe, wee doe without end inculcate that ſentence of the Apoſtle: For wee muſt all appeare at the barre before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, that <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</note> euerie man may receiue the thinges, which hee hath done in his bodie, whether it bee good, or euill. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, we daily make mention of the iudgement to come, of the voyce of the Archangel, and of the trumpet of God: of the Lordes tribunall ſeate, before which wee muſt all bee conuented, there to giue accomptes vnto God of our whole life, who will pay vnto euerie man as hee hath deſerued, rewardes, or puniſhments, as both the Euangelicall, and Apoſtolicall doctrine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. Yea, and euerie one is diligently put in minde of his duetie by our Preachers.

            <p>And againe: Princes are not a terrour to them that <note place="margin">The duetie of the Magiſtrate. The ſubiectes duetie.</note> doe well, but to them which doeyll.</p>
            <p>The ſubiectes heare this ſentence: Let euerie ſoule bee ſubiect vnto the higher powers: for there is no power but of God. Whoſoeuer therefore reſiſteth the <note place="margin">

Item: Giue therefore to all men their duetie: tribute to whome yee owe tribute, cuſtome to whome cuſtome, feare to whome feare, honour to whome honour is due. The married man heareth this <note place="margin">The husbandes duetie.</note> ſaying: Husbandes, loue your wiues, and bee not bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto them.

And as the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, euen ſo let <note place="margin">Parents dutie. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. 4. 5. 6. Childrens duetie.

Fathers heare this ſaying: Prouoke not your children to wrath: but bring them vp in inſtruction, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lorde. Children heare this ſaying: Obey your parents in the Lorde: for this is right. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes heare this ſaying: Bee obedient vnto them that are your maiſters according to the fleſh, with feare, and trembling, in ſingleneſſe of your heartes, as vnto Chriſt, not with ſeruice to the eye, as men pleaſers, but as the ſeruantes of Chriſt, &amp;c. The maiſter heareth this ſaying: <note place="margin">The maiſters due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> Ye maiſters ſhewe to your ſeruantes equitie, and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, knowing that you alſo haue a maiſter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him. The Preacher, or Paſtour of the Lordes flocke, heareth this <note place="margin">The Preachers duetie. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.</note> ſaying, Feede the flock of Chriſt, as much as lieth in you, careing for it, not by conſtraint, but willingly: not for filthie lucre, but of a readie minde. The rich man hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this ſaying: Charge them that are riche in this <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.

The <note place="margin">The cuſtomers duetie. <hi>Luke.</hi> 3. 13. 14.</note> Publicane, Cuſtomer, or Toulner, heareth this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Exact, and require no more, than that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you.</p>
            <p>The ſouldier heareth this ſaying: Doe violence to no <note place="margin">The ſouldiers duetie.</note> man, accuſe no man falſly, but bee content with your wages. Wherefore, ſith. that our Preachers doe daily, &amp; perpetually beate into the eares, and mindes of all men, theſe, &amp; other innumerable ſentences of holie Scripture, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:185160:56"/>
ſeeing that they preach the word diligently, ſeeing that they are inſtant, and vrge men in ſeaſon, and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing that they improue, rebuke, and exhorte, as S. Paule warneth Timothie, they are falſly accuſed to haue hitherto pampered, and foſtered to much the licentious liuing of the common people. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that which our aduerſaries doe obiect of vice, and wickedneſſe, which beareth ſuch a ſway in this age, is (as I ſaide before) truer than I would it were.</p>
            <p>Now, albeit there haue bene men alwayes euen from <note place="margin">Chriſtians in name, and not in deede.</note> the beginning of the Church, which did profeſſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie rather in name, and title, than in verie deede, of which ſorte Hilarie ſaith thus: They pray, becauſe they feare: they ſinne, becauſe it is their will, &amp; pleaſure: they <note place="margin">Hilarie.</note> call them ſelues Chriſtians, becauſe they haue a good hope of eternitie: they doe heatheniſh thinges, becauſe preſent thinges are flattering thinges: they remaine not altogether impious, becauſe they haue the name of God in ſome honour: they are not godlie, becauſe they followe ſuch thinges as are farre from godlineſſe: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I doe beleeue, that all vices did ſcarſe at <note place="margin">The great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this our age.</note> any time beare ſuch a ſway in any age, as in this our age. Wee doe all of vs bragge, and boaſt of our faith, but wee doe not declare, and ſhewe forth this our <note place="margin">A vaine vaunt of faith without good workes.</note> faith by godlie woorkes, and by charitie towardes our neighbour. Wee all glorie of the Goſpell of Chriſt, but wee ſtudie not to liue worthie of the Goſpell of Chriſt. Wee teach, and preach, that wee haue receiued the pure religion of Chriſt, but wee doe not perfourme in deede <note place="margin">Much profeſsing now a dayes, but ſmall practiſing.</note> thoſe thinges which are agreeable to it. Wee will (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) both bee and alſo bee accounted Chriſtians, which name verely ought to make vs ſomewhat aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to breake Gods commaundementes: but wee doe not endeuour with all our mind, and labour, to leade a life after the imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt. To be briefe, we confeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:185160:57"/>
God in woordes, as the Apoſtle ſaith, but in our deedes <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16.</note> wee denie him.

            </p>
            <p>At the leaſt, let thoſe moſte ſweete admonitions, <note place="margin">Saint Paules ſweete exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</note> and exhortations of S.

            <p>Thoſe places of Scripture ought verely to moue vs chiefly, and before all other, which haue the mention of Chriſtes death and puniſhment ioyned with them. Such an one is that ſaying of Saint Peter: Chriſt (ſaith he) <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</note> his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the tree. For what doeth he adde? That we being dead to ſinne, ſhould liue to righteouſneſſe. The like place is that to Titus: Chriſt (ſaith he) gaue himſelfe for vs. What doth he adde? That he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</note> and purge vs to be a peculiar people vnto himſelfe, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good woorkes. And to the Galathians: Which <note place="margin">

And to the Corinthians: Chriſt died for all. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15.</note> He addeth: That they which liue ſhould not liue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to themſelues, but vnto him, which died, and roſe againe for them. And to the Coloſsians: Chriſt hath <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 22.</note> reconciled you in the bodie of his fleſhe through death. He addeth: To make you holie, and vnblameable, and without fault in his ſight.</p>
            <p>Now, whom the diuell (who, as Iohn ſaith in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe which ſinne through hope of Gods mercie.</note> ſeduceth the whole worlde) feedeth with an hope of Gods mercie and goodneſſe, and whom he by

nor idolatours, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor theeues, nor couetous perſons, nor dronkardes, nor railers, nor extortioners ſhall inherite the kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>I would to God, I woulde to God, that wee would acknowledge in parte, and ſtudie to be thankefull for ſo notable a benefite of GOD, in reſtoring this ſacred doctrine, and that after ſo greate ignorance, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men in matters perteining to ſaluation, and which are chiefly neceſſarie to bee knowen.</p>
            <p>Which thing verely woulde come to paſſe, firſt if <note place="margin">How we may be thankefull to God for this great benefite of the Goſpell.</note> wee, thinking vpon the infelicitie, and olde ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former times, and beeing as it were aſtonied at Gods greate benefites, would breake foorth into the praiſes of God, into Pſalmes, and hymnes, into ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſonges, ſinging and making melodie to the Lorde in our heartes, giuing thankes alwayes for all thinges vnto GOD, euen the father, in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, if wee woulde labour to promote, and ſet forward the miniſterie of the woorde, to keepe, honour, to defend, and manteine godlie teachers, if we would labour to helpe, and releeue the neceſſarie ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Church.

This vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is our gratitude, and thankfulneſſe towardes that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and notable benefite of God, which he beſtowed vpon vs, in taking away from among vs ſuperſtitions, and in inſtauring holie and ſacred doctrine. No man truely can either declare in woorde, or ſhadowe out in thought, how excellent, and how great this benefite of God is. For now at the length we haue learned whiche is the holie, Catholike, Apoſtolicall, orthodox, and true <note place="margin">Now it is well knowen which is the catholike Church,</note> Chriſtian Church: and what that communion of Saints is, whereunto they muſt ioyne them ſelues in faith, in will, in opinion, in prayer, and in confeſsion, whoſoeuer will be members of the people of God, and of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall bodie (whereof Chriſt is the head) in what parte of the world ſoeuer they liue in. Nowe we haue learned <note place="margin">All men ſaued onelie by faith in Chriſt.</note> that thing, whiche almoſt no man heeretofore knew, namely that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſaued by Chriſt alone, &amp; no man by his owne merites: that all men obteine ſaluation, and eternall felicitie through the Mediatour the ſonne of God, not for the dignitie of their woorkes: by whiche <note place="margin">Both we at this day and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in old time were ſaued by the ſame faith.</note> meanes verely both the Patriarches, and alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, &amp; the people of Iſrael, and finally all the godlie, which haue bene from the creation of the world vnto this day, haue bene ſaued. For Chriſt, as he that ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:185160:61"/>
come to bee the deliuerer of mankinde, was promiſed from the beginning. Wherevppon in the Reuelation there is that mention of the Lambe, whiche was ſlaine from the originall of the worlde. Therefore the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 8. The Goſpell was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde.</note> or Euangell, that is to ſay, that forgiueneſſe of ſinnes reuealed, and promiſed from heauen, by the free goodneſſe of GOD for the deliuerer to come, hath bene alwayes euen from the verie beginning of mankinde, though not yet in name, and in woord, yet in deed, and in truth. For this redeemer Chriſt is that ſeede of the woman promiſed vnto Adam, which ſhoulde breake the ſerpentes heade, that is, which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 8.</note> ſhoulde deſtroy the woorkes of the Diuell, to witte, ſinne and death. Hee is the ſeede of Abraham, in which ſeede all the nations of the earth ſhoulde bee <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15 <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22.</note> bleſſed. Hee is that Prophete promiſed by Moſes. Hee is the ſonne of Dauid, who ſhoulde reigne ouer the houſe of Iacob foreuer. This is hee whiche was ſhadowed by the Leuiticall ſacrifices, and foretolde by the oracles of the Prophetes.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee haue all the godlie, which haue bene euen from the beginning of the worlde, ioyned with vs in the profeſsion of the ſame faith. For looke in whome the Patriarches, the Prophetes, and the people of Iſrael placed all their confidence, in the Meſsias promiſed to them: in the very ſame Chriſt nowe exhibited vnto vs, both Apoſtles, Martyres, Confeſſours: and finally, wee all put our hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>And this is the true Churche, whiche wee haue <note place="margin">vvhich is the true Church and Communion of Saintes. vvhat kinde of ſocietie the Church is.</note> learned out of this doctrine renewed: this is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saintes, which, being (as I ſaide before) euen from the beginning of the worlde, after the promiſe concerning the deliuerer to come, was firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, and continued in the Patriarches, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:62"/>
afterwardes in the Apoſtles, &amp; Martyrs, &amp; ſo on continueth, &amp; perſeuereth vnto this day by diuerſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, &amp; orders of Chriſtians, profeſsing the ſame faith, &amp; perfourming, &amp; ſhewing obedience to the Miniſters of the Church. The ſonne of God our Lord, and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt doeth, by his woord, and Goſpell gouerne, <note place="margin">How Chriſt ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Church.</note> and by his holy Spirit helpe, and aſsiſt this Church, and this communion of Saintes. O thrice happie, and foure times bleſſed are they, whiche ioyne them ſelues vnto the ſocietie of this Church, whiche hath the ſonne of <note place="margin">The ſocietie of the Church is perfect felicitie.</note> GOD for her Preſident, the Angels for her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, the holy Ghoſt for her ſanctifier: finally, all the godlie, and electe of all ages, as many as are ordeined to eternall life, for her fellowes, and companions. In this Church thou ſhalt finde Adam, Noah, Melchiſedech, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Moſes, Samuel, Dauid, Eſaie, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, to bee ſhort, all the Patriarches, Prophets, Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Martyres, virgins, confeſſours, and the holy Angels of God mixed among all theſe. Who would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame, and cry out with the Prophet? O howe amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are thy Tabernacles, O Lorde of hoſtes? My ſoule <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 1. 2. 4. 12.</note> fainteth, and conſumeth away, through the deſire of thine houſe. Bleſſed are they whiche dwell in thine houſe, O Lord, whiche extoll thee with perpetuall prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Bleſſed is hee, O Lorde, whiche putteth his truſt in thee.</p>
            <p>Howe greately, I pray you, doe I thinke that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are moued with theſe thinges? Doe I doate, and am I rauiſhed out of meaſure with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe thinges? Or are other men alſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched with the like feeling that I am?</p>
            <p>Surely I my ſelfe, as often as I am conuerſant in the cogitation, and remembraunce of theſe thinges, conceiue in my minde an incredible pleaſure, and as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Secreat ioyes doe creepe into my</hi>

            <p>And truely, both many other thinges doe recreate, <note place="margin">The great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which a Chriſtian man may receiue by meditating and muſing vpon the Communion of Saintes.</note> and refreſh mee, as that communion of Saintes, and that one, and the ſame faith, euen from the laſt originall of the worlde, of all Patriarches, Prophets, and of the people of Iſrael, and of ours at this day in Chriſt, promiſed indeed to them, but now alreadie exhibited, and giuen to vs: and that moſt bleſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie hereafter, with all the Saintes in the celeſtiall kingdome, vnto whiche I aſpire with a feruent deſire, whiche nowe alſo mee thinkes I enioy, and receiue well nigh a certeine taſt of the future felicitie, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in Heauen: and alſo the Capteine him ſelfe and heade of this Church, our Lorde, and Redeemer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, doeth after a maruellous manner moue mee, <note place="margin">Comforts which we receiue by Chriſt crucified for vs.</note> delight me, and well nigh bring mee into a traunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my ſelfe, when I thinke vppon him.

For wee liue ſo, that wee differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all from Epicures, that the name of God is for our ſakes contumeliouſly reproched, and euill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of amongſt the Turkes: that wee doe alienate all men from religion, vnto which wee ought, by our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt manners, and good conuerſation to inuite, and to allure all men.</p>
            <p>And in the meane ſeaſon, whileſt we liue ſo, wee both greeue the holie Spirit, and cauſe that wicked, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirit, to reioyce at vs: and alſo wee yeeld our ſelues (whom Chriſt hath redeemed by his bloud) vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to the bondage, ſeruitude, and ſlauerie of Sathan: wee, whom Chriſt hath deliuered from our ſinnes, doe wittingly, &amp; willingly ruſh headlong againe into ſinne: wee, whom he hath made heires of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie kingdome, doe cauſe our ſelues through our owne fault to be diſinherited.</p>
            <p>This verely is all the thankes that wee giue vnto GOD for this doctrine of the Goſpell renewed, this is the thankes wee giue vnto Chriſt for giuing vs ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo wee giue our ſelues to bee ruled, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the holie Ghoſt. With theſe deedes wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and drawe neere vnto the Lordes Table.

ſo doing, ſo wee are like to come vnto Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate.</p>
            <p>But, that I may returne to my purpoſe, truely I my ſelfe thinking, and muſing with my ſelfe vppon Chriſt, (whom wee beginne to confeſſe, and acknowledge truely by this doctrine inſtaured,) am incredibly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and affected: neither is there any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes benefites of what force it is with the godlie.</note> I doe receiue either greater comfort, or greater pleaſure, than by the remembraunce of Chriſtes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, and of the good will of our heauenlie father towardes vs, who hath ſo loued the worlde, that he hath preferred our ſaluation before the loue of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſonne.</p>
            <p>And falling into this cogitation, I can not temper, and refraine my ſelfe, but I muſt needes exclame, and crie out, ſundrie times with Saint Paule: If God be on our ſide for vs, who can be againſt vs? Hee that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">

            <p>I will make an end, after I ſhall haue added one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine thing. I haue ſpoken, and entreated hitherto, of the felicitie, or happineſſe of this our age, and nowe a great while I haue vttered foorth many wordes of this matter.

<pb facs="tcp:185160:66"/>
ſo many, ſo long, ſo cruell, ſo peſtiferous, ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo deadlie, and dolefull warres: yea, and the ſame moſt commonly ciuil warres: whereby it comes to <note place="margin">Ciuil warres in Germanie.</note> paſſe, that Germanie doeth deſtroy her ſelfe with her owne ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Our aduerſaries are not aſhamed to aſsigne the cauſe <note place="margin">An aunſweare.</note> both of theſe, and other euils, to the religion now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaured.

            <p>Yea, and the Ethnikes in times paſt tranſferred the <note place="margin">So did Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an complaine as it appeareth by S.

Oro vos ante Tiberium, id eſt, ante Chriſti ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentum, quantae clades &amp; orbem &amp; vrbem caeciderunt, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, If Tyber (ſaith he) runne and flowe ouer the walles, if Nilus doeth not ouerflowe and water the fieldes, if the heauens haue ſtoode ſtill, if the earth hath moued, if famine, if peſtilence, haue come amongſt men, they crie out ſtreightway: Away with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: haue them hence to the Lions.
<pb facs="tcp:185160:67"/>
I beſeeche you before Tiberius, that is, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, what great deſtructions, and calamities, fell vpon both the whole world, and alſo vpon the citie of Rome it ſelfe? &amp;c. Wee will heere bring in nothing concerning the cauſes why God doth afflict the world, with ſo many, and ſundrie calamities: for the tractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and handling of that matter, doeth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine properly to this argument, which we haue in hand.</p>
            <p>This I ſay briefly, that theſe calamities of the world <note place="margin">Our age may be called happie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come vpon vs. For the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Goſpell counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiſeth all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> are no lette, and impediment, why this our age ſhould bee leſſe happie for the renouation of the heauenlie doctrine. For, if wee will iudge aright, and truely, the benefite which God beſtowed vppon vs, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Goſpell, it is ſo great, that looke what calamitie ſoeuer chaunceth, it is eaſily ouerwhelmed with the greatneſſe of the benefite, and it ſcarſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, eſpecially amongſt them, which haue any care, and regarde of their owne ſaluation. For theſe men, becauſe they knowe aſſuredly, that this is life euerlaſting, that wee acknowledge the true GOD, and Ieſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent, they eſteeme <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. 3.</note> ſo much this notice, and knowledge of the true God, and of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this one thing, they ſet naught by all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and earthlie thinges, whether they be good, or bad.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that they are throughly perſuaded to haue God friendlie, and fauourable vnto them for Chriſtes ſake, they doe eaſily contemne, and deſpiſe all other things, they doe eaſily ſuffer all aduerſitie, &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: yea, they do not feare, &amp; dread no not death it ſelfe. They knowe that their ſinnes are pardoned, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen them for Chriſt, that they are reconciled vnto God, that they are adopted to be the ſonnes of God,
<pb facs="tcp:185160:67"/>
that the inheritaunce of eternall life is promiſed vnto them, they haue learned to call vpon God truely, and vnfeignedly. Theſe thinges they ſo much eſteeme, and make ſo greate account of, that whatſoeuer befalles to them, they beare it patiently, and with a quiet minde: yea, though the bruſed world ſhould ſlide, and fall, and ruines ruſh vppon their heades vnwares, as the Poet ſaith, yet they would not bee affraide or diſmaide awhit. They well remember that they haue no ſtedfaſt ſeate, nor ſure dwelling place in earth, but that they are here in exile, and baniſhment, and that they liue heere as Pilgrims, and ſtraungers. Therefore they alwayes ſigh deepely, and deſire feruently, that eternall and celeſtiall <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2.</note> countrie, and they vſe this worlde, as though they vſed it not, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs to doe. They doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.</note> that death is not the finall end of life, but a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of bleſſed immortalitie, and a paſſage out of this world vnto the father. Wherefore, they deſire both <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Luke.</hi> 2. 29.</note> with S. Paule to bee diſſolued, and alſo with Simeon to departe hence in peace.</p>
            <p>In the meane ſpace, whatſoeuer happeneth, they ſuffer it ſtoutely, and with a good courage. They put all their hope and truſt in Chriſt alone. Neither for all that, are the godlie no whit moued, either with publike euilles, <note place="margin">How the godlie are moued with calamities.</note> or priuate calamities (for they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not put off the nature of man, and they can not refuſe the common ſenſe of nature:) but they doe iudge, that our ſinnes haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, and they reckon that in reſpect, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods will, all thinges are to be ſuffered of vs. They doe beleeue, that by this meanes they are prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto repentance, that they are pricked forward to prayer, to requeſt Gods ayde and aſsiſtance. Therefore they ſtudie to exerciſe both ther faith in prayer: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, and alſo their patience in tolerating, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb facs="tcp:185160:68"/>
aduerſitie, and ill happes. For they are perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that calamities come not vpon men by chance, but that they are ſent of God. And truely, it is not to bee <note place="margin">Calamities come not by fortune, but are ſent of God.</note> doubted, but that theſe are puniſhmentes for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mankinde. And our men haue learned out of this renewed doctrine, that both priuate miſeries, and afflictions, and alſo publike calamities, are after <note place="margin">Publike calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are as it were the voyce of the lawe.</note> a ſorte the voyce of the Lawe, whiche ſtirreth men vp to the remembraunce of GODS wrath againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and whiche exhorteth them vnto repentance. For, becauſe the Sermons, whiche are preached in the Church, concerning GODS iudgement, doe not greately moue the obſtinate, and ſtifnecked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, therefore GOD would that both publike, <note place="margin">VVherefore and to what end ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are ſent of God.</note> and priuate calamities ſhoulde preache vnto vs of repentaunce, that ſo wee might ſtudie to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ſinnes, and lament, and bee ſorie for them: For looke what Iohn Baptiſt in Saint Matthaewes Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note place="margin">

So that, looke what the Lawe of GOD coulde not doe in woordes, that doeth God labour to obteine by ſending calamities. And the greateneſſe of GODS wrath againſt ſinne, which no man can expreſſe, as it is woorthie, by any force of ſpeeche: that calamities are woont to ſhadowe out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſorte vnto vs, how greate it is.

So then the godlie are not onely not <note place="margin">How the godlie ſuffer calamities.</note> grieued to ſee them ſelues afflicted with many miſeries, but alſo they account it a greate benefite, becauſe they are chaſtened of God wholeſomely, and after a fatherlie faſhion, and what caſualtie ſoeuer GOD bringeth vpon them, they ſuffer it manfully, and with a ioyfull minde. I will not heere adde, how that at all times, and in all ages there were certeine fatall (as it were) calamities of mankinde, and certeine puniſhmentes of the world, left that any man ſhould thinke, that ſome new thing had happened to this our age, or leaſt that any man ſhould defame theſe preſent times (that I may vſe the woordes of Oroſius) as more infeſted, and annoyed with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances, <note place="margin">Orofius.</note> and ill happes, than other times were woont to haue bene, becauſe of this heauenlie doctrine rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,

becauſe we beleeue in Chriſt, &amp; acknowledge him to be the author of mans ſaluation, &amp; becauſe now God is moſt truely woorſhipped in ſpirit &amp; trueth. For as in our time, ſo there haue ben in all ages paſt, many times, which haue bene either greeuous by reaſon of warres, or corrupt with diſeaſes, or ſorowfull for famine, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible for erthquakes, or ſtrange times for innundations &amp; greate floudes of waters, or fearefull for breaking out of fire, or cruell for blaſtinges, thunderboltes, &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, for boyſterous blowes of haileſtones, or elſe (as the ſame Oroſius ſaith) miſerable times for murders of father and mother, and for all heinous villanies, &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe that can bee: which thing the Chronicles, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and monumentes of antiquitie doe teſtifie.</p>
